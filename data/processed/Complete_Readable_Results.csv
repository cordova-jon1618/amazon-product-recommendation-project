"ARM & HAMMER Super Washing Soda Household Cleaner and Laundry Booster, Versatile Natural Home Cleaner, Powder Laundry Additive and Cleaner, 55 oz Box",4.99,4.8,"I have received no compensation of any type, manner, or kind, for, before, or after purchase, or review. I have no connection with the seller, or producer of the product other than as a purchaser, either before purchase, or after purchase.I really love this stuff. I use it in my water to soften it so cleaners a laundry detergent work better.Put it in a spray bottle with some hot water and it makes a great effective grease buster, add some Dawn and WOW! You've got surfactants and softer water and a  super duper grease busting recipe. It doesn't take a lot either.  1 small squirt of Dawn, and a teaspoon of washing soda to 32 oz of warm to hot but not boiling water. I would test a small hidden area if you're not sure about color fastness. I would also test aluminum in an inconspicuous spot, or anything for that matter.Try it on grease spots in the driveway.I know it absolutely does wonders for laundry and stripping the gray out of white and all other colors to. It removes the build up from clothes washed in hard water. It also helps remove stains.One warning wear gloves this is the exact opposite of acids. Itcan lower the PH of water to 10 - 11 depending on how much you use,  which can do a number on bareBe careful with it,  follow the directions on the package, and you will. Have a cost effective product good for many  different uses.I'm sure there are other ways to use it that I haven't discovered yet.So, 5 stars from me for value, ease of use, effectiveness, many applications and uses.

"COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare",16.99,4.6,"First things first I absolutely appreciate the fact that this product came with the seal on the outside of the box which made me feel secure that I was getting a brand new product! The pumps come already in the bottle of these products which is why the seal being on the box is a big indicator for me ( stating this to say that this is the authentic product it just comes with the pump already in the bottle for those who are iffy. To be sure, you should have to pump the pump a few times before product comes out, if product comes out on first pump with any product, it's been used. I know this from working in beauty stores). Upon applying the product to my skin OMG!!! it's so moisturizing!! instantly firmed and smoothed my skin and gave it this beautiful glow! I like the little retinol that came with it as well. I will give an update of photos of my skin in a few weeks to show the progress of the products. The second pic is of the power essence after being used a few days which should let you know these bottles come filled to the top ensuring you get your money's worth!! I will definitely be ordering again as I'm already loving the feel of this product and highly recommend!!

"Amazon Basics Enameled Cast Iron Covered Round Dutch Oven, 4.3-Quart, White",46.64,4.7,"Finally used this dutch oven for the first time since catching it at a great price. After deep frying some boneless, skinless chicken breasts Nashville style, I confess that I am blown away. This is a heavy-duty, well built dutch oven that will likely outlast me and be passed along to another generation. It is heavy but the construction is solid and the features are impressive. The white enamel interior is a snap to clean, the handles are broad and easy to grip and the lid fits snugly and is capped by an impressive metal handle. The fact that the lid features condensation nipples speaks to the fact that the design and  execution are classic and well executed. I would wholeheartedly recommend this workhorse if it cost $100 or more. Well done Amazon, well done. BTW, I'm still using Le Creseut enameled cast-iron pieces I purchased 40 years ago.

"Nature Valley Soft-Baked Oatmeal Squares, Peanut Butter Breakfast Snacks, 12 ct, 14.88 OZ",6.78,4.6,"TBH, I had mid expectations for these but they kinda blew me away. I know that the Nature Valley team are hot to shoehorn the actual word oatmeal into their product skus but hey fam... ""oatmeal square"" really isn't doing this bad boy any favors in the moniker department.  It's a soft peanut butter oatmeal cookie. And a darn good one too. Probably about the best I've had from a factory.These DO have a healthy dose of oats along with a very respectable peanut butter punch. I can easily put away three or four of these at a time without breaking a sweat. They are the kind of treat you will want to buy in the Value Pack size because they will go quickly.

"Amazon Basics Tritan BPA-Free Plastic Stemless Wine Glass, 14-Ounce, Clear - Set of 4",26.48,4.5,"Back yard, pool area, when traveling, park, beach...you need these. Water, juice, wine, spritzers, whatever. These outdoor plastic tumblers are the best. We use them when we're out in our yard because we have kids and trust me when I say that I have cleaned up more broken glass on the pavers than I wish I had and it never gets fully picked up. When it's windy or you have kids running around, it's easy to pick up a plastic cup that gets knocked over. They're pretty thick and don't have a sharp rim so very easy to drink from them. They're small in terms of an actual wine glass, but that's not a big deal because they look so stylish. Sometimes the kids want their drinks in them and for this price point I have no problem. They work well with wine glass pens and while they are dishwasher safe, I recommend hand washing them to keep them from becoming cloudy or streaked. They're great for the beach and park too since they have a little weight and don't go flying off in the wind, or break when stepped on. We also take these to hotels with us so we can have drinks in the room from nice clean cups.

I have been looking for a facial sunscreen that doesn't feel too thick, greasy, or hard to rub in without leaving white residue. This sunscreen fit the bill. I haven't had a chance to test it out on a highly sunny day yet, but I really love how light it feels on my skin. The sunscreen rubs into the skin really easily and goes on smooth and covers the face and neck easily. It feels like a little goes a long way. I was also happy to see it is colorless so I don't have to deal with the annoying white streaks that can be hard to rub in with some SPFs. I plan on getting a second one to keep in my purse for reapplication throughout the day.

"Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper, 24lb, 8.5-x-11-inch, 1 mega ream (800 sheet), 97 Bright, White",15.67,4.7,"Pros:Quality Printouts: Produces sharp, clear text and graphics.Cost-Effective: Priced competitively, offering great value for the amount of paper.Versatile: Suitable for a wide range of printers and copiers.Eco-Friendly: Made from sustainably sourced materials.Jam-Free: Smooth surface leads to fewer jams in the printer.Cons:Not Ideal for High-Resolution Printing: While great for general-purpose use, this paper isn't the best choice for printing high-quality photos or graphics.Slight Opacity: Some bleed-through when using very dark or heavy ink.The Verdict:In today‚Äôs fast-paced work environment, the last thing you need is to be held up by something as fundamental as printer paper. After trying the Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper, it's safe to say that it delivers consistent performance, making it a reliable choice for your everyday printing needs.Firstly, let's talk about quality. The paper has a nice, smooth finish, which results in sharp and clear text. Whether it's an internal memo, client proposals, or basic graphics, the paper does justice to your print job.Cost-effectiveness is another area where this paper shines. Given the competitive pricing, I find it to be a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality. In terms of cost-per-sheet, it's one of the more affordable choices, making it an excellent pick for bulk printing.Versatility is yet another positive. This paper is compatible with various printers and copiers, which is a significant advantage. It's convenient if you switch between different printing devices like me.On the eco-friendly front, the paper is made from sustainably sourced materials. While it may not be the highest grade of recycled paper, it's still a step in the right direction for those concerned about their environmental impact.Now, for a point that may go unnoticed but is crucial: this paper is jam-resistant. While using it, I've encountered significantly fewer printer jams, which is always a time-saver in a busy work setting.However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The paper is not ideal for high-resolution printing. If you want to print professional-grade photos or high-quality graphics, opt for a more specialized paper. I also noticed some slight bleed-throughs when using heavy or dark ink.In conclusion, the Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper offers a solid performance for general-purpose printing tasks. While it may not be your go-to for specialized print jobs, its reliability, versatility, and cost-effectiveness make it a strong contender for everyday office needs.

I've used them for music, movies, and work meetings; vocals and bass are great.Connectivity: They took literally one minute to start working out of the box. I turned them on, paired them up with my phone, and instantly they synched-up without issues. Every time I turn them on they connect flawlessly.Portability: They are easy to carry around. They fold flat and inwards, so they fit easily in any bag without  taking much space.Battery-life: They charge fast, in around a couple of hours, and the battery lasts long. I have charged them once after a full week of daily use at work and a 6hr. flight.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery | Weather-Resistant Outdoor Camera, Live View, Color Night Vision, Two-way Talk, Motion alerts, Works with Alexa | White",69.99,4.6,"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already.  I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't.  None.  Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways.  I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed.  Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house.  Nope.  There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not.  They are not location aware in any way.  The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording.  Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours.  Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room.  I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on.  This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%.  This is with all the 'battery saving options' on.  This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording.  So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing.  I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality.  The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera.  You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then.  Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't.  Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera.  The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support.  Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"".  This will be a great update and should have been available on launch.  I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days.  It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration.  With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set.  They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away.  For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off.  You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc.  Or any combination.  The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can.  This is a great improvement.  They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5.  This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras.  I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now.  All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night.  Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad.  I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation.  They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.

"Amazon Smart Thermostat ‚Äì Save money and energy - Works with Alexa and Ring - C-wire required",79.99,4.1,"I‚Äôm a big Nest fan had it on my old house the problem that I have with them it‚Äôs the cost, and even with gas company great rebate didn‚Äôt justify the cost especially with my new home having a total of 5 thermostats (t-stat). I was excited when I found that Amazon partner with Honeywell to get this t-stat created as Honeywell has been creating t-stat for years which make me feel better when making the purchase.---COST---Now let go over the details for cost it‚Äôs good and I got two of them which at the end of the day will be free due to the electric company rebate for a smart t-stat.  I didn‚Äôt get a C- adapter and I will explain later (INSTALL session) why I purchase a 24-volt transformer for my first-floor unit.---INSTALL---Love the package it reminds me of the NEST when it first starts came with everything that you needed the only additional tools, I need was a harmer, and drill but this is normal for these installations.Now the biggest question that everyone has is the C (common) wire. This is where you need to do your research regardless of what company you go with when upgrading to a smart thermostat, due your homework on what you need. For me I have a spill unit (boiler & A/C) first for my second-floor unit it was super easy I had an extra wire and I use it for Common the t-stat startup and finish within 30 min. Now for my first floor I utilize a 24-volt transformer because I didn‚Äôt have spare cables and I didn‚Äôt want to run a new cable which drove me to make the purchase again do your homework before and see what option best works for your use case.I connected the transformer to the C wire and the other end to Rc and that works like a champ. This is critical if you have a split unit since Honeywell power their t-stat via Rc only when you have two RED Wire (R (heater) and Rc(cooling)) and the blue tab (internal jumper is down position. If you only have one RED Wire you are fine just keep the blue tab up and your t-stat will turn on without any problems.  I did reach out to Honeywell and explain to them they need to explain this on their site and white papers that when you have split units‚Äô power for the t-stat will come from Rc and not from R this is critical because my house previous owner installed a switch to keep the A/C unit down through the winter to avoid accident turning on the unit which is great idea. Please keep in mind this is NOT an Amazon problem that is Honeywell they did acknowledge their mistake and agree to update their site and documentation.Running my transformer cable and installing the unit took me about 60 minutes because I wanted to look perfect with the transformer cable going through the wall this make the installation look cleaner.----SETUP----Once all wire were connected the setup of the t-stat was simply and when I say simple it was super didn‚Äôt have input the WiFi password or anything else since it automatic joined my account that was amazing and simply just like setting a fire table that was a great experience. Amazon did an amazing job doing this some users this my not be as good, but I look automation the less click I must do the less chances of mistake A+---LOOK---The t-stat looks great after the final install the wall panel (included but optional for install) made it easier for me since I didn‚Äôt have to paint (if you had a different color paint I would recommend adjusting before completing the install but that is just me)---Interface (GUI)----For me the GUI is great for some it my but I‚Äôm one of those people that like to have one application on my phone or tablet rather than 2 and this is where Amazon did another amazing job. Please keep in mind that Google who purchase NEST is doing the same thing I see the NEST application going away in the future all new NEST is configure from Google Home and they also did a great job The GUI it‚Äôs simple and allows you to setup multiple schedules and copy them to different days or week. Huge plus on my book because for the NEST I had to do manually per day I can setup one day and copy to another. You can setup away and home schedule or utilize your current Amazon device to tell the t-stat that you are home or away. Another item that I love from the Amazon you can setup MAX cooling or heating this allows for mistake not to happen and getting your house too hot or cool really go option to have and you can set filter replacements without your assistance (optional) for me this is great no more remembering air filter as they will show up at my footsteps.Energy saving incentives can also be done via the application. The dashboard its great too it tells you how much energy you utilize each day and where you can save.Now the only downside for that I experience is only scheduling session on Android because it forces close my Alexa application all the time, I don‚Äôt have this problem with anything else on the application just the scheduling session. This option works perfect on my wife new iPhone and iPad pro and new Android phone. My old Android is the one with this problem, but I experience this kind of thing on and off since it‚Äôs an older device.-------Final judgment ----The device is good option for a smart t-stat and would recommend for anyone some of the problems that were reported it was on day one which is expected with any new launch overall I see this t-stat giving Google (NEST) and others a run for their money as now you have a great option for smart t-stat and you don‚Äôt require to break your budget to acquire one. In addition, love the one application for everything as previously mentioned all big companies are doing this model to stop the install of some many other applications. In a scale from 0 -10 this t-stat gets a 9 please note that the NEST 3rd gen got a 9 from me. Hope this helps everyone make the correct decision and I will update this review in a few weeks to report back.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",59.99,4.3,"ALL of the Blink stuff I have ordered is getting this same review.  After doing an insane amount of research for a home security camera system I settled on Blink for ease of set up and cost.  In both of those areas there really isn't a close second.  As far as reliability, I'll check in again in a year or two--but other reviews indicate reliability is good.  So, good news: easy set-up, great prices, video quality is as good as any, motion sensors and other software adjustable stuff is easy to understand and do.Bad news:  The system is crazy slow.  I knew that going in, so it might be a bigger deal to you.  I'm willing to live with it mostly--down the road I plan to put in a much faster, wired, real time system with only one or two cameras, and Blink has a new ""Sync Module"" that is supposed to have greater range--and maybe speed things up a bit.  The slow is annoying...but not a deal breaker.It has notified me of low batteries a few times--so now I just let it go and they seem to recover on their own.  I've also had one or two go offline and I had to reinstall them.  I think there are two factors causing this, and again for the price I am willing to live with it.  For one thing I have the wireless range maxed out even with an extender for my WiFi network.  The other factor is it is currently the dead of Winter and cold beyond all reason.  9 degrees last night, high is 31 today.  Lots of snow and wind, too.  I'm harder to get along with in this weather myself, so I'll put up with some additional problems with electronics that live outside.Bottom line?  After three months I'm happy with it and I recommend any and all of the parts of the system I've bought.  It works as advertised and it's way cheap--including the annual subscription if you want cloud storage.  I will be buying a couple more pieces soon.  It is fully functional as long as you don't need a lot of speed.  I'm talking about minutes when I‚Äôm antsy and want seconds.

"Amazon Basics Padded Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Adjustable Height/Tilt, 360-Degree Swivel, 275 Pound Capacity, 24 x 24.2 x 34.8 Inches, Black",95.37,4.3,"I recently turned a spare bedroom into an office and needed a nice chair to go with my new desk.After comparing several different chairs from retail stores and several on Amazon I decided to order this one.My decided factor was ultimately the price. I do not work from home and just use my office a few days a week, a couple hours at a time so I didn't need a $200+ chair. I didn't want the mesh back and I like the fact that this one has the arms and it is super padded and comfortable to be a smaller chair.As far as size, my husband who is almost 200lb, could sit in it comfortably. Anyone 200lb+ or on the taller side, this chair is probably not the best choice. I also can't say how comfortable it would be if you WFH and use it multiple hours a day.Overall, I am super happy with my purchase and the quality of the chair. I also want to add that putting it together was pretty easy. Leave the arms loose until you get the back on then tighten everything up.

"Amazon Smart Thermostat ‚Äì Save money and energy - Works with Alexa and Ring - C-wire required",79.99,4.1,"I‚Äôm a big Nest fan had it on my old house the problem that I have with them it‚Äôs the cost, and even with gas company great rebate didn‚Äôt justify the cost especially with my new home having a total of 5 thermostats (t-stat). I was excited when I found that Amazon partner with Honeywell to get this t-stat created as Honeywell has been creating t-stat for years which make me feel better when making the purchase.---COST---Now let go over the details for cost it‚Äôs good and I got two of them which at the end of the day will be free due to the electric company rebate for a smart t-stat.  I didn‚Äôt get a C- adapter and I will explain later (INSTALL session) why I purchase a 24-volt transformer for my first-floor unit.---INSTALL---Love the package it reminds me of the NEST when it first starts came with everything that you needed the only additional tools, I need was a harmer, and drill but this is normal for these installations.Now the biggest question that everyone has is the C (common) wire. This is where you need to do your research regardless of what company you go with when upgrading to a smart thermostat, due your homework on what you need. For me I have a spill unit (boiler & A/C) first for my second-floor unit it was super easy I had an extra wire and I use it for Common the t-stat startup and finish within 30 min. Now for my first floor I utilize a 24-volt transformer because I didn‚Äôt have spare cables and I didn‚Äôt want to run a new cable which drove me to make the purchase again do your homework before and see what option best works for your use case.I connected the transformer to the C wire and the other end to Rc and that works like a champ. This is critical if you have a split unit since Honeywell power their t-stat via Rc only when you have two RED Wire (R (heater) and Rc(cooling)) and the blue tab (internal jumper is down position. If you only have one RED Wire you are fine just keep the blue tab up and your t-stat will turn on without any problems.  I did reach out to Honeywell and explain to them they need to explain this on their site and white papers that when you have split units‚Äô power for the t-stat will come from Rc and not from R this is critical because my house previous owner installed a switch to keep the A/C unit down through the winter to avoid accident turning on the unit which is great idea. Please keep in mind this is NOT an Amazon problem that is Honeywell they did acknowledge their mistake and agree to update their site and documentation.Running my transformer cable and installing the unit took me about 60 minutes because I wanted to look perfect with the transformer cable going through the wall this make the installation look cleaner.----SETUP----Once all wire were connected the setup of the t-stat was simply and when I say simple it was super didn‚Äôt have input the WiFi password or anything else since it automatic joined my account that was amazing and simply just like setting a fire table that was a great experience. Amazon did an amazing job doing this some users this my not be as good, but I look automation the less click I must do the less chances of mistake A+---LOOK---The t-stat looks great after the final install the wall panel (included but optional for install) made it easier for me since I didn‚Äôt have to paint (if you had a different color paint I would recommend adjusting before completing the install but that is just me)---Interface (GUI)----For me the GUI is great for some it my but I‚Äôm one of those people that like to have one application on my phone or tablet rather than 2 and this is where Amazon did another amazing job. Please keep in mind that Google who purchase NEST is doing the same thing I see the NEST application going away in the future all new NEST is configure from Google Home and they also did a great job The GUI it‚Äôs simple and allows you to setup multiple schedules and copy them to different days or week. Huge plus on my book because for the NEST I had to do manually per day I can setup one day and copy to another. You can setup away and home schedule or utilize your current Amazon device to tell the t-stat that you are home or away. Another item that I love from the Amazon you can setup MAX cooling or heating this allows for mistake not to happen and getting your house too hot or cool really go option to have and you can set filter replacements without your assistance (optional) for me this is great no more remembering air filter as they will show up at my footsteps.Energy saving incentives can also be done via the application. The dashboard its great too it tells you how much energy you utilize each day and where you can save.Now the only downside for that I experience is only scheduling session on Android because it forces close my Alexa application all the time, I don‚Äôt have this problem with anything else on the application just the scheduling session. This option works perfect on my wife new iPhone and iPad pro and new Android phone. My old Android is the one with this problem, but I experience this kind of thing on and off since it‚Äôs an older device.-------Final judgment ----The device is good option for a smart t-stat and would recommend for anyone some of the problems that were reported it was on day one which is expected with any new launch overall I see this t-stat giving Google (NEST) and others a run for their money as now you have a great option for smart t-stat and you don‚Äôt require to break your budget to acquire one. In addition, love the one application for everything as previously mentioned all big companies are doing this model to stop the install of some many other applications. In a scale from 0 -10 this t-stat gets a 9 please note that the NEST 3rd gen got a 9 from me. Hope this helps everyone make the correct decision and I will update this review in a few weeks to report back.

"Bride",13.48,4.5,"I just loved reading Bride! I‚Äôve read 3 other Ali Hazelwood books, and am always uniquely challenged intellectually by her writing. This is something I grapple with and love throughout reading Hazelwood‚Äôs book.I was excited to read a new adventure of hers that is unlike her other books, bordering on the genre of Omegaverse and monster-romance. I love the idea of ‚Äúfated mates,‚Äù but I was never a huge fan of arranged marriage tropes, so I was interested to see if I would like it.The main FMC, Misery, is witty with dry humor, and a bold personality that makes her overtly honest. We get the entire book from her perspective, so Misery‚Äôs character grows on you, as Hazelwood reveals her backstory. The MMC, Lowe, is not only a sexy, Alpha werewolf, but he also is a strong, intelligent man who is a duty-bound pack leader. The author builds and develops many other side characters in a way that makes them memorable, and important to drive the plot rather than a support for the main characters. This is something I really appreciate about all of her books, is the side characters always play a significant role in different plot points.Their relationship is a ‚Äúhe-falls-first‚Äù but the fmc doesn‚Äôt know it yet, similar to the plots of her other books. However, I find the relationship between Misery and Lowe develops uniquely in different circumstances due to the Vampire/Werewolf/Human dynamic and politics that drive the plot of the book. Lowe and Misery get to know each other, share playful and teasing banter, plus the tension build-up is oh, so satisfying.It is always an absolute pleasure to read Ali Hazelwood‚Äôs books, and there is a slight tease at the end for a sequel to this book, so I‚Äôll be interested to see if there‚Äôs another‚Ä¶I really hope so! I would absolutely recommend this to others, and give it 5 stars for the reading experience, amazing characters, and stunning storytelling.

"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, 1)",13.38,4.5,"I have to admit that this book is probably not one that I would have immediately grabbed after reading the description, but after seeing glowing review after glowing review my curiosity was ignited, so I pre-ordered this one from amazon. I'm so glad that I listened to the reviewers and grabbed this one. What a treat to read!No summary of the plot that I could write would accurately show just how awesome this story is. There is action and mystery and the supernatural. There is a love story ... sort of. It's pretty subtle at this point in the story. This is a story of survival as well as a story of a society which is potentially at the dawn of a new age. This is the story of a girl who has gotten by in this life by taking care of herself and herself alone for the most part, but who finds herself letting her guard down enough to find friendship and companionship. There are so many things to like about this story. I think I'll boil all of it down to these things:Celaena Sardothien. What an amazing heroine for this series! She is so strong. So strong. She can kick just about everyone's tail at every turn. She is smart and athletic and cunning. She has a big heart, but she is not in any hurry to let anyone really see that. She finds joy and happiness in life despite all of the hardship and trial that has been thrown her way. I love her because even though she is strong and a capable fighter, she is also emotional and vulnerable at times. She doesn't have to be stoic to show her strength. There is still so much more to learn about her. I can't wait to see what future books in this series reveal about her and her destiny to help her oppressed people. Even she doesn't exactly know how she fits into any grand plans, but I'm excited to see how she moves into her new roles as the series continues. She is fun to read about.Chaol Westfall, Captain of the Royal Guards. Oh how I loved this character! Chaol is a no nonsense guard who doesn't let his guard down around Celaena because he recognizes her potential for violence and mischief. He sees her strength and her intelligence, and he knows that she would just as quickly slit his throat as anything in order to gain freedom if she could. He trains her diligently and seems to understand her more than anyone else. In the process he seems to grow attached to her, but he never really comes out and says anything. His actions show his feelings more than any words he utters. So many times I just willed him to say what he was feeling, but I'm not sure that even he knows exactly what he is feeling. He was a fascinating guy to read about. I want to know more about him in the future books as well.Prince Dorian. Yes, there is a love triangle in this book ... sort of. It's not really one I guess because Dorian is in love with Celaena, and Celaena sort of likes Dorian, but Chaol is there too. The only difference is that Chaol and Celaena don't ever really explore their feelings for one another, either to themselves or each other. So it's kind of a weak love triangle. Nevertheless, I have to say that I love the character of Dorian. My heart breaks for him in so many ways. It has to be hard to be the son of such a horrible king. But it seems as if Dorian is beginning to form his own path by the end of this book. There is still more to discover with this character. I just know that I love him with his love of books and his kindness toward Celaena. I have the feeling that he will play a pivotal role in the future of this society if things will ever work out to help the oppressed.The ideas of this book. There are so many interesting themes that are being thrown about in this novel. I think it was interesting to see the way that the government had tried to eliminate knowledge from the people by destroying books and history. Now that knowledge is being held by the king who could potentially use it against the people. But it seems as if those who are rebelling have kept some of that knowledge, and that will prevent the government from having power over them. Knowledge is definitely power in this world as well as our own I'd say. I think that the idea of freedom in this book is interesting as well. Freedom is a powerful motivation for Celaena, but it is something that Dorian seeks as well. So many people in this society are not truly free, and eventually they will need to make some tough choices to see what they will sacrifice to gain that freedom. There is still so much more to discover as this series progresses.The pacing of this book was wonderful. Not too fast, not too slow. I felt as if I was slowly unwrapping a Christmas package, layer by layer, slowing discovering the parts of the book that would come together to create such a detailed and layered story. I almost wish that I had waited to read this book until the next book in the series had been published because I want to know so much more. I have definitely discovered a new favorite, I think. Future books will determine whether this one becomes a classic for me that I will read over and over again, but for now I'd say that Throne of Glass is a wonderful beginning to a fascinating and engaging new series. Five stars!

"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",16.99,4.8,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.If I could I would rate it 6 stars!The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...You definitely should read this!

"Apple Pencil (2nd Generation): Pixel-Perfect Precision and Industry-Leading Low Latency, Perfect for Note-Taking, Drawing, and Signing documents. Attaches, Charges, and Pairs magnetically.",120.09,4.7,"I recently upgraded to the Apple Pencil 2nd Generation, and it's an absolute game-changer compared to its predecessor. The improvements are not just incremental; they redefine the entire experience of using a stylus with an iPad.Firstly, the design has seen a major overhaul. The 2nd Gen Pencil feels more balanced and comfortable in the hand, making it ideal for extended use. This ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue, which is a blessing for those long drawing or note-taking sessions.One of the most notable upgrades is the charging mechanism. Gone are the days of the awkward charging via the iPad's lightning port. The new Apple Pencil magnetically attaches to the side of the iPad for charging and pairing. This not only makes it more convenient but also ensures that the Pencil is always charged and ready to go.The addition of double-tap functionality is a stroke of genius. This customizable feature allows you to switch between tools without breaking your workflow, enhancing productivity and creative flexibility.In terms of performance, the 2nd Gen Pencil offers even lower latency than the first, providing an experience that‚Äôs closer to using a real pen on paper. The precision and responsiveness are unparalleled, making drawing and writing incredibly fluid and natural.Lastly, the matte finish of the 2nd Gen Pencil provides a better grip compared to the glossy finish of the first generation, further adding to its ergonomic design.In conclusion, the Apple Pencil 2nd Generation is not just an improvement but a complete evolution from its predecessor. It's an essential tool for anyone serious about using their iPad for drawing, note-taking, or any form of digital creation. The combination of design, functionality, and performance makes it well worth the upgrade.

"Handcraft Blends Lavender Essential Oil - 100% Pure and Natural - Premium Grade Essential Oil for Diffuser and Aromatherapy - 0.33 Fl Oz",4.99,4.5,"I was really nervous about buying essential oils online because all the ones I‚Äôve tried to buy in stores were not good and the reviews online for others had some pretty negative reviews. For Christmas I was gifted an oil diffuser along with the hand craft blends essential oils lavender and lemongrass (the same brand as this one) which are the bigger bottles with the droplet and I must say I absolutely love them! It was one of the reasons I wanted to buy and look for different scents. So I decided to look up this brand to see if there was any online which to my surprise the vast amount they had in different scents! I got the peppermint, orange, and ylang ylang. I was a bit hesitant because the reviews said they didn‚Äôt smell good, didn‚Äôt smell like the scent they got, has a really light fragrance, etc, but I bought it anyway and I am so happy I did! The orange smells exactly like when you peel an orange and is so fragrant so because when you go in to get a sniff! The peppermint is my absolute favorite because it‚Äôs my favorite scent and flavor for stuff (however I looked it up and it says do not consume or put this on your skin as it is not made for it. I‚Äôm not sure if this product is specifically made for that so do your own research before you decide to try it!)  the peppermint smelt so nice and relaxing <3 the ylang ylang was a bit different than what I imagined that‚Äôs why I got the smaller version for that one. And on another note this stuff last for a pretty good time for the powerful scents they give. I‚Äôve been using my lavender essential oil every other day to everyday since mid January and it‚Äôs still a little more than half way full! I never write reviews but had to for this product. It makes my room and home feel so cozy and refreshing so I would highly recommend you get it! :>

"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",44.82,4.7,"As CTO of a software company I co-founded, I'm not only looking for books that help me improve individually, but also books that the whole development team ‚Äì from developers to architects ‚Äì may find useful. Robert C. Martin‚Äôs Clean Code does both, and, like the good code described therein, it‚Äôs well written, clear, and easy to read. Martin includes many helpful examples and his suggestions are applicable to any programming language.Ideally, each developer takes charge of their own education and is constantly improving their skillset, an aspect that Martin covers in The Clean Coder. I view it as an important part of my job to help my team improve. To do so, I distill a lot of written material down to actionable components and provide that to my development team. Concepts from Clean Code have become very helpful guides for them. Below are a few of my favorite takeaways.The first is what Martin calls The Boy Scout Rule: ‚ÄúLeave the campground a little cleaner than you found it.‚Äù It‚Äôs a great concept, not only because it's simple to follow, but also because it has broad applicability and can be used on any project. Essentially, when a team member works on a piece of code, they should aim to improve it somehow by the time their task is finished. A few examples of this among many are: fixing an unclear variable name, breaking up a large function into smaller functions, or cleaning up a conditional for improved clarity. With everyone on the team doing this, the code improves over time and everyone feels responsible for the code whether they wrote it personally or not. Even if something can‚Äôt be addressed immediately, developers are encouraged to log the issues they see.Another of my favorite takeaways is the Three Laws of TDD, a concept I was able to quickly roll out to the team as a framework to follow for how TDD should be conducted on a project. This virtually ensures that all of your product code has test coverage. It also helps make most of your code SOLID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29), since code that is built in this fashion is structured with SOLID concepts in mind. This is a must for effective testing.Finally, the topics of proper identifier names and commenting really resonated with me and my team. In our company, we tend to ‚Äúadopt‚Äù existing codebases ‚Äì projects that have already been started by other developers whose code is of widely varying quality. If we're lucky, it's structured well and demonstrates best practices and approaches in how it's constructed. Unfortunately, the code is sloppy at times and requires some TLC to get it in shape. A part of that process is understanding what the existing application does. As Clean Code correctly outlines, many comments are superfluous or even plain wrong and misleading. As a team, we don‚Äôt blindly trust the accuracy of existing comments and instead go right to the application‚Äôs code to determine what it does. This is where proper naming comes into play. With good names, the code reads like comments or as a narrative of what the application does, nullifying most needs for additional commenting. Simply put, the code comments itself. We also use refactoring tools to improve names and clean up comments as we go. Of course, by doing so, we‚Äôre also applying the Boy Scout Rule.Overall, Clean Code is a wonderful book with much useful and immediately-applicable information for developers of all levels. If you're looking for a book that will help make you a better developer, this will.

I love how much faster my curly hair dries using this dryer with diffuser. I also purchased the insurance for piece of mind. I couldn't afford the Dyson so this was a great alternative. I saw reviews about how loud it is .....not sure why. It's actually quieter than my cheaper hair dryer. I can actually have a conversation with my daughter while drying her hair.It is a little heavier than my cheaper dryer, and the cord is hefty, but that's not a problem, since I spend less time holding it, cuz it dries hair faster.

"Amazon Smart Plug | Works with Alexa | control lights with voice | easy to set up and use",24.99,4.7,"The only other smart plugs and switches I have currently are all Z-wave based (about 20) and I've never had issues with any of them and have them all programmed on schedules and various alerts as well as manual control.  However, obtaining Z-wave based products are getting harder and harder because it seems the market is flooded with so many off-brand plugs and switches tied to a variety of ecosystems.My preference has always been for Z-wave because those devices operate on their own wireless band outside of my 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless networks and instead communicate only to a hub that is connected to the internet.  I'm still not sold on switching out my smart devices for devices that need persistent internet access and consume wireless bandwidth but do like that this device is very easy to setup and use.I currently have this in my kids' room connected to a Vornado fan that they can call upon if they want some airflow in their room and not affect anyone else.  I've used a Z-wave switch for this in the past and have controlled it for them or set it on a schedule because I didn't want them to have access to the SmartThings app to be able to control that device and others.Setup and adoption were easy, maybe a little easier than SmartThings. Calling out to Alexa to control the device is intuitive and works well to set timers and basic on/off.However, now that the device is on my wifi network, I see that it uploads and downloads 1-5KB of data twice an hour starting at about 9 minutes after the hour and again 5 minutes later with an Amazon server with ""device-metrics""  in the hostname.  Not sure what it's doing exactly, my guess would be exchanging telemetry data or phoning home.Overall, it's a a good smart plug that's easy to use and can be trusted to some extent if you're already using Amazon devices in your home rather than tie yourself into some other ecosystem that sends data to a foreign country.

"Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones, 60H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Memory Foam Ear Cups, for Travel, Home Office",49.99,4.5,"Update Dec 2023- These headphones are still as awesome as the day I received them in 2019!  Ankar is truly hard to beat.  Just in case you‚Äôre looking for a pair I can vouch for the quality of these.I‚Äôve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick & mortar store, but the price caused me to pause.  On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon‚Äôs return policy & Anker‚Äôs reputation for quality.I‚Äôve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results.  They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can‚Äôt hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality & price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn‚Äôt believe the price.  He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were & he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones & didn‚Äôt pay $$$ for them,They pair easily and are comfortable - until I‚Äôve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that‚Äôs after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs & battery is still strong, time fly by.There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones.  2) the headband could use a slight redesign.  Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about  (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit & my hair gets pulled  so I have to adjust them & keep going, I‚Äôve no idea how they could do this it‚Äôs something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don‚Äôt compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called & I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find & adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don‚Äôt always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about.  Also the aux cable is included though I haven‚Äôt used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn‚Äôt have a case to put them in for my flight & no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first classLove these headphones, the ANC & overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks & sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some.  I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to try them out if you‚Äôre looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn‚Äôt break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you‚Äôre going to love them.Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I‚Äôm not an audiophile but I can‚Äôt find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound.  I like a variety of music & I hear good  bass, mid tones & treble, vocal it‚Äôs all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn‚Äôt break the bank & with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, & other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.Sorry for overly long review, there‚Äôs so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I‚Äôve experienced as possible, I‚Äôve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they‚Äôre brutally honest good or bad & I appreciate that.I‚Äôve had & used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate  them, they‚Äôve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop. UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones.  That says a lot about the sound & quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones & that I recommended Ankers.Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon & AnkerUPDATE:  if you‚Äôve read my review you know I‚Äôve had this set of headphones since Dec 2019 it‚Äôs Nov 29 2023. I  thought I would need to replace them this week but not so fast! Removed them from the pouch they came with, paired with new iPhone and wore them while preparing dinner continuing until bedtime always after midnight.  The quality of sound, the hours of comfort while carrying on with everything needed to be done, the joy of listening to many genres of music was fantastic even taking a call.In 2019 I think there was 1 color choice, sure I‚Äôd loved to have had the choices Anker has today but I didn‚Äôt buy them as a fashion statement but for the Anker quality, outstanding customer service in every product they put the Anker name on.  These headphones have not diminished in sound quality whether I‚Äôm jamming as I go through daily chores, or taking or making phone calls while wearing this same pair of headphones.In this current economic environment I‚Äôm thrilled for Anker‚Äôs dedication to quality while delivering headphones that are affordable. And providing a fantastic choiceI wanted Amazon shoppers to know they have a choice if shopping for headphones that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice sound or quality or lasting performance.  When I‚Äôm looking for another set of headphones or the Anker Liberty Air EarPods or the many chargers I‚Äôve bought, I always look for Anker/Soundcore first I know the quality and their outstanding customer supportThanks everyone Happy Shopping

"Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Dryer Sheets, Lavender, 80 ct",7.03,4.3,"I have never been disappointed in any of the Mrs Meyers Clean Day products but a few really stand out, including these dryer sheets.  The fragrance is amazing and fresh without being overly perfumed, or artificial smelling.  In fact, whenever I open a new box of the honeysuckle dryer sheets, everyone in my house grabs a few to stash in their dresser drawers, under their pillowcases and between the couch cushions.  We have very hard water at our house and this can cause our laundry to feel slightly stiffer over time; however, these dryer sheets deliver fabric that feels a little better to the touch with noticeably reduced static.  :)

Maybe over time the ability to hold different positions will loosen & it will be necessary to tighten the locking knobs under each arm. But so far I spend several hours each day, comfortably sitting at various angles. It feel quite sturdy but can be easily folded up for compact storage in a closet or on a shelf if wanted.

"Swiffer Sweeper 2-in-1 Mops for Floor Cleaning, Dry and Wet Multi Surface Floor Cleaner, Sweeping and Mopping Starter Kit, Includes 1 Mop + 19 Refills, 20 Piece Set",18.44,4.6,"If you haven‚Äôt heard of the Swiffer you‚Äôve probably been living under a rock. That said I had never owned one until now. We recently swapped out our carpet floors for bamboo so we needed something easy to clean it with that wouldn‚Äôt take up a ton of closet space. I guess all the commercials worked because I gravitated towards this mop.It shipped quickly, was easy to assemble (didn‚Äôt need the instructions), and it‚Äôs easy to maneuver around.  The handle doesn‚Äôt extend or anything but I‚Äôm ok with that. Also it comes with a few disposable dry pads and a few wet pads. I‚Äôve given both of them a try and I think the dry pads have more use in day to day life but honestly the pads are the weakest point of the mop. Super convenient but not the best at actually cleaning.Also maybe it's just my sensitive nose talking but I found the wet ones to be really strong fragrance-wise. They worked well, but the smell just seemed to linger and I wasn‚Äôt really a fan of that. It seemed to dry fast though.That said I quickly realized how expensive these pads are to replace, especially if you use 5-6 pads during your weekly cleaning session like I do.So instead of buying another pack of refills, I ended up buying a set of reusable microfiber mop pads that I can wash and reuse from Amazon. If you search reusable swiffer pads on Amazon you can likely find them, they are the green multi-surface ones with the white straps on the backside.Anyways, they work great with the swiffer. The size matches and you can put it on easily with the velcro. The only thing is that they‚Äôre not pre-wet (since well, they‚Äôre more of a cloth) so you have to use it with a separate bottle of cleaner. I just ended up using white vinegar and water, spray the whole rooms floor in like 30 seconds and then get down to business.I will say, however, that the swiffer is not designed for heavy scrubbing. I mean, you could probably do it but honestly for spots that need that kind of cleaning, I just go on my knees with a regular cloth.A list of pros and cons:(+)- The swiffer is compact and very lightweight- Easy to set up, you can start using it within minutes- Doesn‚Äôt take up much space in the storage closet- The mop is really cheap so I‚Äôm not worried if one of the kids breaks it- It comes with all the stuff you need to use it right away(-)- The handle is kind of flimsy and not extendable so you might have to bend down- Refill pads are kind of expensive but you probably already know that- The mop head isn‚Äôt very big so it might not be best for larger areas- Wet pads have a very strong fragrance that lingers after cleaningOverall‚Ä¶I am still pleased with the purchase. It's not perfect but then again I didn‚Äôt expect it to be anyway when I bought it. For under $20 (not including the refills that you have to get), it does the job well and I‚Äôm satisfied with the results. Plus with how light weight the mop is basically anyone of any age can use it. If you‚Äôve got kids or elderly parents in the home this is probably one of the better options out there.

I think, while in a pinch it would be palatable, you'd really need to have a bottle of water with you to help you get through it, but even at that, the taste would still probably carry the day.

Its texture is exactly like a makeup primer and doesn't leave white marks/ colour like other sunscreens. It is also not sticky like a 'moisturizer in humid conditions'. If I have to compare this one to Shiseido sunscreen (Vita-clear vitamin C), this Supergoop is a bit more powdery, smooth and kind of dried slippery feeling to the touch after it dried out a bit. It is great for the base before makeup and also nice for guys if they don't want to have white faces.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",41.99,4.3,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
¬†If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped.

"Amazon Smart Thermostat ‚Äì Save money and energy - Works with Alexa and Ring - C-wire required",79.99,4.1,"I‚Äôve been holding off on buying this thermostat for quite some time based on reviews and even considered other pricier brands for the same reason but I finally decided to give it a try because I‚Äôm sick of having to go over to the thermostat and manually adjust it (first world problem right?)I am so pleased with my decision that immediately after installing it, I bought a second on for upstairs.Installation was easy and took about 15-20 minutes to install and set up in the app.  The unit mounts with 3 screws and anchors, a small screwdriver tool and an optional wall plate. A word of advice - use a better screwdriver because the included tool isn‚Äôt great. You‚Äôll also need a drill with a 3/8‚Äù bit to assist with the wall anchors.Some of the reviews I read mentioned that people had trouble with the app recognizing two thermostats, that was not the case at all with me. It was extremely easy to differentiate in the app and just as easy to control each one.Another review that made me worry about buying this thermostat was that you couldn‚Äôt simply tell your Alexa device to adjust the temperature, and that you had to open the app to make adjustments. This problem must have been resolved or a solitary issue because ours works just fine with voice commands.This thermostat does not offer a sensor option to monitor a particular room or area, so if you‚Äôre looking for that, you may need to look at other options.As far as smart settings, you have two options. Alexa can learn your routines and track your phone‚Äôs location to adjust the temperatures accordingly when you‚Äôre home or away. This works best when everyone in the household connects to the app and consents to tracking. It will even adjust the temperature to your desired settings when you‚Äôre within a certain range of your home.If this option isn‚Äôt for you, it will allow you to set schedules and desired temperature ranges throughout each day of the week. But you‚Äôre still able to log into the app and make adjustments when needed.My last tidbit of information is regarding the second unit that I bought, it was a ‚Äúrenewed unit‚Äù and priced at $40. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect and I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between it and the new one, it came with all new mounting hardware and was just as easy to install as the first one that I bought.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",59.99,4.3,"‚ÄúChange previous review to a strong 5.‚Äù KEVIN from Blink customer service reached out to me and after doing diagnostics on his end, it was determined that the camera was faulty. He immediately sent me a new doorbell which is now working great with my other 5 blink cameras. Can‚Äôt ask for more than that.Stopped working after couple months. Now Will not add to app. Have tried every fix there is on internet for many hours. On a whim I deleted and reinstalled another blink camera. Installed just fine, so I know my home system is working. Tried to return to amazon but apparently only have one month. Warranty says a year. Have 5 other blink cameras around house. So disappointed. Thought Amazon would stand behind their product.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",59.99,4.3,"I think that Blink support is great they actually tried to reach out to me when I posted a negative review. So for that effort in them wanting to help I give the company 5 stars. As for the product itself I give 3 stars because it picks up everything even a tree branch on a tree moving. I hate to see what will happen with my blink when a wind storm comes through. Last night it picked up a wolf coming through my yard. With Ring it only picked up people and packages which is what I want a video doorbell to do. I left Ring because of the price hike they did this year. They went from $30 to $49 a yr and I would have paid a small hike and counted it as inflation but that big of a hike and Im gone.I had made a negative feedback originally because I could not get my chime to work. Well I got a professional to come out and fix it and come to find out it was because I just mounted it to the wall and expected it to work but I did not know you also have to go through all the steps in the app to get the chime to work. When I went through all the steps it started working. I would like to get in touch with support again because I cant get the blink doorbell to work with my echo shows like my ring doorbell did

¬†***Notice: on March 6th, 2024 I have updated this review. I would append the original version, but combined with this would be too much text. If you wish to view the original version, I would suggest using the way-back machine found on the internet archive.***Preface:I have been using this tablet on-and-off for about 9 months as of the time of writing. I actually went and bought the (2023) Pixel Tablet, and installed LineageOS on it for a clean android experience, and even though not always mentioned, it is the basis of comparison for a lot of my complaints. Above all else however, it is important to note the price disparity, $230 for the Fire 11, versus $500 for the Pixel Tablet - To some less privileged, that might be enough to make it affordable whilst keeping food on the table.Chassis:Unlike any other Amazon tablet to date, this device is supported by an aluminum body, with only a single plastic insert near the top, where the speaker holes are. My only qualm is the camera bump - the rear facing camera has a bump, despite having the same resolution (8 megapixels) as the selfy camera which is flush under the screen's glass.Display and Sound:It's display is adequate, it's efficient and gets bright enough to do any task in nearly any lighting condition. The resolution however brings mixed feelings; I can notice slight aliasing (where smooth curves and angled lines can look like stairs, with distinct steps/layers) of icons on the homescreen, but not when reading books or viewing content. Since most content is produced in either 4k or 1080, increasing the resolution any higher would make the device more expensive and produce weird aliasing until you scaled the screen to 4k. Even the pixel tablet doesn't reach 4k, with a 2560x1600 screen and providing a smoother homescreen but aliasing for content if you look closely at it.Sound quality is surprisingly good. This isn't something that will rival a dedicated speaker, like an Echo or something from Bose, but I've enjoyed many a night laying in bed, watching YouTube and other content on it, without any concerns for the sound quality.Software:FireOS 8, based on android 11. It seemed palatable at launch, and it's going to be less so as the device ages, considering android 14 launched later in 2023. I'd be more mad about the version, except that there's been no interesting or really major changes in android since android 11, which has the side effect of allowing various apps an easier time maintaining compatibility.I would highly recommend anyone who's interested look up the Android Police's articles on installing the Google Play Store, it will make your experience a lot nicer (although I do note that sometimes the Google Play Store does not like it when you install SD cards, you may wish to get the 128GB model).Make no mistake however, I am thoroughly irritated at Amazon's update policy; They promise software updates and support for 4 years after the device is last available for purchase, which is industry-leading. This however does not include major OS version updates: My Fire HD 10 (2021), is still running FireOS 7, based on android 9, much to my annoyance. For a device this expensive, Amazon should be able to provide the same software support other vendors do, and update it to FireOS 9 whenever that comes out.The UI is simplistic, with a homescreen that an apple user would find familiar, but with the android controls that any lifelong android user would be able to navigate with ease. I wish Amazon would port gesture navigation, to bring the device up to parity with any Android and Apple phone released in the past 5 years, but I'm instead given 3-button navigation, which sometimes leads me to accidentally swipe backwards ineffectively.I did once complain that the Google Play Games login did not work on the device, but Amazon actually seems to have resolved that in an update released shortly after launch. I can now play Homeworld mobile, and have my progress saved across multiple devices.Performance:The processor is fast enough to not only navigate the UI, browse the web using Chrome, but even emulate some DS games (with Drastic), and play some dedicated android games. I still maintain that a device with 4GB of ram shouldn't be expected to run modern Android apps, but that's the price issue.Of slightly more annoyance, is the WiFi adapter: I've tested it and found it tops out at around 50-100 megabits per second, which is enough to stream content (1080p content is less than 5), which is weird since I have devices that adhere to the same WiFi 5 standard, that are able to download much faster. I can only presume that internally the WiFi adapter is either budget, or is connected to the processor via some really slow bus internally, like serial or something.Accessories:Amazon offers a stylus and keyboard folio. The stylus is rather interesting as Amazon includes handwriting to text conversion on the device, allowing you to write in any text box you want. I've used it a few times to take notes quickly before sending them to someone via Discord. It uses the rather rare AAAA battery, which is annoying to source replacements for, but I'd rather replace the battery than be stuck with an internal one like Apple does, since Apple's stylus will become a paperweight once the battery dies.The keyboard however is the star of the show - I love how it's folio is 2-piece, allowing me to remove the keyboard and toss it wherever if I don't need it, yet retain the (very stable) kickstand of it's backing piece. The feel of the keys themselves are meh, and I'm annoyed by the function key where the CRTL key should be, but it's not enough of a problem. It finds frequent use, allowing me to write messages on Discord, or handle other tasks without needing to bring my bulky laptop with me. The trackpad however, is useless - Android doesn't need it, and it feels a bit weird and rough.Features:This is the first tablet Amazon has released with a fingerprint sensor, and I'm honestly surprised by how reliable it is. Amazon's on-device messaging with the fingerprint sensor is also helpful (for example, it will inform you that it's been more than 72 hours since the PIN was last used, and for security reasons, forbid further fingerprint unlocks until you unlock it with the PIN at least once). It's extremely fast and seamless, immediately dropping me to the homescreen with a gentle tap of the sensor - I don't have to actually click the power button down.Desires:I understand wireless charging is an impossibility with the aluminum chassis, but I really wish Amazon released a charging/speaker dock for this thing. There's already pogo pins on the bottom for the keyboard, it wouldn't be hard to repurpose them for a dock, and it would encourage users to use it in the ""show mode"" that Amazon advertises this thing is capable of.I'd also really want major version updates. When FireOS 9 comes out, I want that on this device, not to be stuck on android 11 forever. This is Amazon's flagship, and it's powerful enough to handle it.Above all else however, I want Amazon to let me unlock the bootloader. I understand these devices are likely sold at a loss, so maybe let me buy an un-refundable unlock code for my device to make up the difference for Amazon, but let me do it.Conclusion:There's a lot of gaps where this device falls short, but it's basically unbeatable at this price range. If $500 seems insurmountable for your situation, or you want a disposable device to give a family member or child, you can't go wrong with this. My complaints whilst numerous, are not enough to drop it's rating from 5 stars in my eyes - it's still found a happy home with me.

"Burn After Writing (Celestial)",7.32,4.6,"My 14yr old daughter asked for this book a couple mnths ago. She's in 9th grade and this is a popular book that she heard about. My daughter plays sports and is a sporty girl, but she also likes to get fixed up and be girly. She started High School this year at a new school with new friends, had to do the majority of school online, juggle two sports, and has her first boyfriend of almost 7mnths. With all of these new things going on at this time in her life, she thought this book would be fun to fill out and look back on, or burn! As did I.There are no actual matches, of course. It's just a flat picture that really does looks like a 3d match box. I knew it didn't come with any matches before ordering, which is probably good depending on who this is bought for, but I just thought I'd mention it. You can get this book in different colors. I know there's this pink, a blue, & a gray. Possibly other colors, but those are the ones I specifically seen when looking for this.I scrolled through this book/journal, and it seems like a fun book to fill out and possibly learn a little about yourself. I know the theme is to fill it out and dispose, but I think this would be a great treasure to save to look back on and reminisce, as well as to see how much you've learned, changed, or grown overtime. I think this would be fun for many different ages, and not just teenagers. It would be great to have for when you're traveling, bored, or just in the mood to do some soul searching. It would be fun to fill out with a group of friends even. I think this would be a positive gift for anyone, especially those who enjoy reading or writing. My daughter hasn't finished this yet, but she has started and is enjoying the experience. She's happy with the purchase, and does recommend this to others. I took a few pictures to help give you an idea of what to expect in person and to show you a few examples. I hope our experience and pictures helps you in some way.

"Bride",13.48,4.5,"As someone who has been reading exclusively romantasy for the past year, I bought this book on a whim, knowing that I don‚Äôt particularly care for contemporary settings, but with the hype this book was getting on Instagram, I thought ‚Äúa good book is a good book‚Äù. Coming from reading all of Sarah J Maas‚Äô ACOTAR books, and Jennifer Armentrout, both writers who tend to be very descriptive even overly so, both in describing the environment and the characters‚Äô internal monologue/thought process, the more ‚Äúlean‚Äù style of writing in this book was different for me. The first third of the book was a bit boring for me, because I found the world building to be not enough, and that the writer chose to speed through or ‚Äúskip forward‚Äù interactions that I would have liked to read through instead of being left to my own imagination. I would describe the beginning half as low stakes, chick lit.  I am someone who likes to read a detailed interaction between the main characters in a romance novel because I feel like that helps the emotions and tensions culminate to that sweet moment when they express their feelings for each other. In this book, I found myself having to ‚Äúfill in the blanks‚Äù or use my own imagination a lot on how emotions were displayed. The writer says things like ‚ÄúI know he was happy‚Äù, and I found myself asking ‚Äúhow does she just know that? How exactly is he ‚Äúradiating happiness‚Äù ? However, the last third to fourth of the book did come with lots of twists and high emotions which pleasantly surprised me and kept me hooked so that I ended up binge reading to finish it. And at the end, I could say I wanted more, and would buy a sequel if Ali Hazelwood decided to write one! I did appreciate how the main character was more even keeled than some other female main characters in romance novels who tend to come off as impulsive, stubborn to the point of being defiant just for the sake of being so and almost inconsiderate (immediately saying no when they are told or asked to do something by the love interest simply because ‚Äúnobody tells me what to do‚Äù without thinking about why the person might be asking that of them). I found Misery to be mature in her emotional reactions and not impulsive or insecure. She can be quite flippant and casual in her dialogue even during serious moments, but this generally works in the book as part of her character as someone who isn‚Äôt afraid and doesn‚Äôt sweat the small or medium stuff. She does come off a bit as a ‚Äúknow it all‚Äù but her intelligence is supposed to be one of her strengths and she actually shows it with her dialogue, rather than us simply being told that the main character is intelligent even though she doesn‚Äôt exactly seem clever by any of her words or actions in the book.Overall, this was a pleasant quick read, and though the beginning required some dedication to plow through, the ending left me wishing for more! I thought the plot itself was fantastic and the conflicts were generally mature and not cliche and frustrating where two people could simply actually have a purposeful conversation and avoid a whole lot of drama (one of my major pet peeves but tends to be like a land mine in romance novel land). This book would have been a 5 for me if the world building was a bit more descriptive and emotions and perceptions were also described more thoroughly.

"The Artist's Way Workbook",12.49,4.6,"I have struggled for more than 11 years to get through this book. (I know 100% I'm not the only one.)I bought the audio version and listened to it all the way through in a week. I got done, and felt so much better! I loved it!  Then I bought this workbook.I'm slowly working my way through the workbook. It's a bit challenging, but I'm pushing through, and definitely feeling so much more creative. My life is opening up in new & unexpected ways & I can't wait to see where I end up. I've got some doors starting to appear and I'm tentatively walking through some of them.  This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it to EVERYONE. Not just folks who think they are creative. I mean that - EVERYONE.When my husband and I were dating more than 11 years ago, he didn't know he was creative at all. I have worked him over the years just gently encouraging him. And now he is an artist! He is really exploring it (drawing a LOT on his iPad). I love his artwork!  And this book helped me encourage him over the years despite the fact that I hadn't read very far into it.He is actually the one who bought this for ME probably 12 years ago!!  He was the one with the vision. He is so supportive.

"Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear",11.01,4.5,"‚ÄúAre you considering being a creative person? Too late, you already are one,‚Äù Gilbert asserts. In Big Magic, living a creative life means living a life driven by curiosity over fear and this life is accessible to all who seek it. She breaks down creativity into five essential ingredients: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. Whether readers believe in a magical world or not, her description of ideas, why they choose us, and when and why they leave is inspiring to no end and her roadmap through the twists, turns, and potential pitfalls of creativity are applicable to all who dare to venture on their own creative journey.Gilbert tackles our biggest creative fears and inner demons head-on with delicious humor, wit, and grace. She allows fear a spacious spot in the car on our creative road trip, but never allows it to give us directions and certainly not take the driver‚Äôs seat. Time and again, she effectively and effortlessly silences our inner critic on such universal experiences as: worrying about what others think of us and our creations, bowing to perfectionism instead of completion, evaluating our art as low or high, as brilliant or a disaster, the struggle to declare ourselves worthy of living a creative life, the desire to be fearless or passionate when all we need is courage and curiosity, and much more. She also explores various paradoxes of creativity: the desire for permission and the fact that we never needed it to begin with, that creativity takes persistent hard work on our part and also moments of divine inspiration that come from something else entirely, that no creation is entirely original and yet authentic expressions are always original, and the ultimate paradox: that our creative expression must be the most important thing in the world and it also must not matter at all.Written in easy to digest, bite-size chapters, readers will feel as if they‚Äôre chatting over a glass of wine with their amusing and insightful bestie, Liz, as she masterfully weaves together numerous stories from her personal and professional life with hard-earned creative wisdom, always with an endearing self-awareness that at times borders on self-deprecation, and with a charm that is nearly flirtatious. The lessons are so powerful and relatable that if one were to learn this much about their creative life in a year of therapy, they could consider it a great investment. Big Magic ultimately provides readers with the necessary courage and inspiration to live bigger, happier, and more interesting lives, coaxing out of us our own unique hidden treasures.-- Lisa Blair, MA

"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)",22.88,4.8,"‚ÄúWhen you erupt, girl, make sure it is felt across worlds.‚ÄùI seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review. I'm going to try not to include any spoilers, but if there are any, I'll give you fair warning before reading further. Honestly, I am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book. I honestly don't know how SJM can top this book, but let's get real here...she will because she's just that amazing. I read this in one sitting overnight because I simply couldn't put it down. It's true, this book is a Court of Pain and Feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and I felt incomplete after finishing. SJM seriously took her writing to new heights, and I can't even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journey.‚ÄúThe great joy and honour of my life has been to know you. To call you my family. And I am grateful - more than I can possibly say - that I was given this time with you all.‚ÄùI have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because I always felt that it showed Sarah J. Maas' extreme writing talent. It's so different from the Throne of Glass series, and I loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story. You can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her, and every scene is richly described. Her writing truly sweeps you away and it's something that you easily lose yourself in. I know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into Feyre's world, I would not even hesitate. This story is complex and I never expected for SJM to build on the world so much more than previously, but she does, and it's excellent. There is a great progression to the story, and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characters.‚ÄúWhat we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength.‚ÄùThe book starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While some people might have found this part slow, I think it showcased just how far Feyre has come as a character. The strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her (and Rhysand's) plot was utterly fantastic! I think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us Feyre's mindset at the time. I definitely got some Aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass Feyre was, which just added to my love for her character. But the best thing: Feyre's characterization. I thought she was well-developed already, but SJM added yet another layer to her character. Feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book. Looking back, I can't even believe that this is the same person...and that is an excellent thing. It shows how much Rhys and the Night Court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately become.‚ÄúI would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.‚ÄùRhys is as perfect as ever. I mean come on...who doesn't love him?! The way he treats Feyre made me swoon every darn time, and she is his High Lady in every single way. He gives her something that Tamlin never did...respect. He believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing. He allows her to spread her wings (<-- this is an excellent pun btw...I know I'm really not as funny as I think) and embrace her magic. The constant support and love Rhys shows her is something every girl should have. Plus, he's freaking hilarious...you can't get a better man! I honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top 5 book boyfriends. Obviously the chemistry between Feyre and Rhys is off the charts, and all the sex scenes are perfectly written. I love them together so much, it just makes my heart happy.‚ÄúIt's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.‚ÄùCassian and Nesta are brilliant and I firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books. I need them together, and I need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story! They have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book. We learn more about Mor, and my heart broke for her multiple times. I just wanted to give her a giant hug, but I loved delving deeper into her character. Azriel is brooding as ever, but I love him. There is definitely something up with him and Elain, and I need to know what that something is. Amren's sass is pure gold and I love her so much. There are definitely some surprises with her character that left me (along with the characters) shocked. We also meet a new High Lord, Helion and god do I love him! He has to be in these next 3 books because he's awesome. We also see the return of the Bone Carver and the Suriel. And seriously...they play epic roles in the story. And Tamlin...I have to mention this guy. I actually liked how SJM handled him in this book (especially at the end). It was realistic and believable. And (Lord help me), I didn't hate him anymore.‚ÄúMy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.‚ÄùMy favorite part about this book though (besides all the other stuff) is its unpredictability. Seriously, SJM gave me a heart attack multiple times. Just when I thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story. And there was not 1, not 2, but 3 major things at the end in which I was freaking out and making very weird noises that I'm sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate. The one MAJOR (and I mean MAJOR) thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock. I seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life, and I was praying so hard that SJM didn't do what she did. I think I stopped breathing at one point, so HOW DARE YOU SARAH J MAAS!! HOW DARE YOU SCARE ME LIKE THAT!‚ÄúIt is a new world, and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anew.‚ÄùIf you couldn't tell, I LOVED this book! I still am not okay after reading the entire battle since SJM made me lose my mind, but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything I could want. Most of the main questions were answered, but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing. I think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters' perspectives, but I'm never going to mind more Feyre and Rhys. This is by far the best read of 2017, and you need to read it as soon as humanly possible!Happy reading :)

"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, 1)",13.38,4.5,"Throne of Glass is the first novel in a series of 7 books (with the newest one being released in October 2018). Throne of Glass was actually my least favorite of all of the book in this series. As Cait from A Page with a View said in her Goodreads review, TOG is just not the strongest book in the series. That being said, I do think it‚Äôs a great introductory book. And it was enough to get me into the series in general, which is what I really needed.I have finished all of the released books, at this point. Sorry, guys, no I could not stop in between and review them. I had to devour them. Because ‚Äúholy gods‚Äù this series is amazing.I know some people dislike Sarah J. Maas‚Äôs writing style, but I really like her books. In her newer books especially, (Tower of Dawn, etc.) I feel like her writing is able to convey the thoughts and feelings and reactions of the characters in a really relatable, personal way, without having to be like ‚ÄúBlah blah blah,‚Äù thought Celaena. And if you are familiar with Maas‚Äôs other series, A Court of Thorns and Roses, there are some lines that are word-for-word the same, which is kind of like a little fangirl easter egg hunt.One of my favorite things about Celaena is that she is a dangerous assassin, she‚Äôs strong and wicked and deadly.. and yet she‚Äôs totally sarcastic at times, girlish and feminine and frivolous. I love that Sarah J. Maas wrote a character is who is a complete bad ass, who also likes to look cute and go shopping and wear pretty dresses. Yes! In real life, women are complex and have many different interests simultaneous.That being said, my god, Celaena can get on my nerves sometimes. I try to remember that the girl is only seventeen, despite everything she‚Äôs been through, and is allowed to be more than a tad immature. I have this issue with many YA fantasy books, but I think it might just be me showing my age.But in general, I think Celaena is a rather likeable main character. She‚Äôs not dainty. Definitely not one of the heroines waiting for a man to save her, or even waiting for a man to train her. She‚Äôs bad all by her damn self. And she‚Äôs full of mystery and secrets. You never know what is up her sleeve, or what she‚Äôs hiding, which makes for a lot of excitement.I feel like I don‚Äôt even need to mention this, but of course I will, because I can‚Äôt not. The world building in this book is amazing. Sarah J. Maas is the undisputed queen of worlds in my eyes. I love both of the worlds that she‚Äôs created (that I know of). The TOG world is so rich with history, complexity, and conflict. There is so much that we learn and so much that we don‚Äôt in this book. I want SJM to write endless stories taking place in this world.The ‚ÄúKing‚Äôs Champion‚Äù plot was actually one of the weaker aspects of the book for me. I actually thought it kind of lame. And a bit unbelievable. But anyway, I think that the main plot of the book was rather flimsy.The pacing of the book was slow in the beginning but it picked up after a while. And the twists weren‚Äôt too obvious either, I was surprised once everything was revealed (as much as they are revealed in this book). It‚Äôs definitely a great read and I can see why it has such a large fandom.Final ThoughtsThis series is shaping up so well! The first book is definitely enough to get you hooked but you MUST keep going. It gets so much better. Like I said above, Throne of Glass is easily the weakest book in the series, and if you even liked it somewhat, keep going because it gets a thousand times better.

"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",16.99,4.8,"10/5 starsThe world building, pace of the story, and characters were all amazing. Moments of hilarity in between moments of plot. I loved the characters and how they developed. I wanted to root for Dain and hope I was wrong, but he just pissed me off as the book carried on. I had serious rage levels every time he would try to step in to protect Violet or opened his mouth.I have been so invested in a story in such a long time, but this book gripped me by the shoulders and yanked me inside. Violet and Xaden‚Äòs story developed in a way that I could see happening, but not anticipate how it would go. Finish the story in a day and a half, because I couldn‚Äôt put it down!If you‚Äôd like to read a story that has amazing world building, dragons, magic, a heroine who stands up for herself, and an amazing plot  - READ THIS BOOK.And the end!

"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",44.82,4.7,"As part of our learning activities, we learn quite a few programming languages. We also learn designs, patterns, good coding practices, and many more. We don't usually spend time to learn how to write a good, readable code. The relevance of this book is enormous. Not just the programmers should read it, the education providers should also read it. In fact, the education providers should plan to include this in their curriculum associated with every programming languages.I started reading this book and finished it in almost three consecutive sittings. That way, the book is well structured, and the topics are well sequenced. The author cautioned at the beginning of the book that it is not for the armchair readers. The reader should spend adequate effort to read through the code examples, think through those, and try out some of those through self scribbling. This is indeed necessary for the coders. This is also necessary for the instructors of coding, or programming languages. I chose to skim through the examples with just enough thinking while paying attention to every detail of the English text. Such speed reading worked for me too. Such reading technique should work for all who are not into direct coding today, but was a programmer once upon a time, and spends a lot of time in conversing with the programmers nowadays.Coming back to the content of the book - this was quite informative and thought provoking. I read it fully and tried to jot down my takeaways from this book reading. I have got six of them.I learned the general rules for commenting, and summarized those in four points. I learned the general rules for code formatting, and summarized those in four points. I learned the general practice of code size - for a significant system, for a code file, for a typical function. I learned the general rules of organizing concepts and variables, and summarized those in five points. In fact, the definition of concepts was itself was a new learning for me. I learned the three laws of test driven development, rather I re-learned those once more while reading this book. Finally, I jotted down the final takeaway - leave the code cleaner than what you had started with.The book is full of good references, in fact at the end of every chapter. I tried to summarize the list of further readings, and I got another five book titles listed in my to-read list. I read it on my Kindle device, and on my desktop using Amazon Cloud Reader - the formatting was good.As coders, we all have the responsibility to leave the code cleaner than what we start with. As code reviewers, we all have the responsibility to comment on the cleanliness of the codes. As the supervisor or manager of coders, we all have the responsibility to communicate the importance of clean coding and to encourage coders towards clean coding. I will recommend to all these group of people to read this book, and practice the clean coding techniques described here.Good work indeed!

"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond",63.78,4.6,"This is one of those books about which it is difficult to say enough good things. I found the first edition very influential on my on thinking to say nothing of enlightening. Impressively, the authors have improved this second edition, for example moving the comprehensive sample documentation online, thus making room for more of the lucid and rational explanation of documentation practices that made the first edition so useful.I usually include a discussion of who would benefit from a reading in my reviews. Anybody who thinks they might be producers or consumers of software architecture documentation owes it to themselves to get a copy of this book now. Others might think they have no need for this book, but still should read it. This includes Business Analysts, who, this book makes clear, are stakeholders of software architectures. BAs will also their thinking sharpened on how to develop useful documentation and use graphical notation in a precise and meaningful fashion.This book is on my short list of classics of software engineering. It is a book I return to often. Reading this second edition, even after being fully familiar with the first, was still a richly satisfying experience. I cannot recommend this book enough.

¬†I got this to replace an Epson inkjet printer that had been declining over the last few years and stopped printing most colors. This is by far the most expensive printer I've ever purchased, but I wanted a really good quality printer that would last me a long time and print reliably every time. So far, I'm really pleased.Initial Setup - I was a little concerned after reading reviews that it would take me hours and several calls to customer support to get this thing set up, but it was actually really easy. The instructions list a website to visit to download the software, so I just followed the instructions and was all set up within a few minutes. I did not need to connect the printer to any computers, I just followed the instructions and was able to get everything connected. Make sure you download the mobile and desktop apps and register on the HP Smart website, where you can manage your printer settings.Mobile App - I didn't love the idea of using a mobile app for a printer, but it is actually pretty cool. There's a lot of neat features on there, like printables, which has a bunch of free things to print, such as calendars, coloring pages, activity sheets, cards, crafts, all sorts of stuff! There's also mobile faxing and scanning, the ability to create photo books and more. I probably won't use many of these features, but I do think they are nice to have.Print Quality - I don't print a ton of stuff, but I did a few test prints and they look fantastic so far. Nice quality and clean printing.Mobile Printing - I didn't have to do anything special to print a photo from my phone. I just opened the photo on my phone, tapped the share icon, selected print, and it defaulted to the printer. It took about 30 seconds, but the quality was great on regular printer paper. You may need to keep the photo/file open until you see the print dialog on your phone show that the item is printing.Scan to Email - This was a bit challenging to set up, but I found a helpful article so I'll share how I did this. First, from the desktop HP Smart app, I added our email addresses to the address book in the scan tab. You also MUST have an outgoing email address set up in order to scan to email, so I created a Gmail account for the scanner. In the outgoing email profiles, I added this email address, used smtp.gmail.com for the server and port 465. Check the ""SMTP server requires authentication"" box and enter the email address & password. When I tested it, I got an email that Google blocked the attempt so I researched and found an article instructing to allow less secure apps and had a link (just add /settings/security/lesssecureapps to the Google URL to access this setting). I turned less secure apps on for the printer account, and that did the trick. Note that  a copy of each scan will be saved in the sent folder of that email account.2-Sided Printing - This was not the default setting on my printer, but I was able to select my default print settings from the HP Smart websiteTouchscreen - I think the touchscreen is easy to use. If setup is required for anything, it will display a message explaining exactly how to do what's needed, so that's really helpful.I've only had this printer a short time, but I'm really pleased with it so far.

"Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones, 60H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Memory Foam Ear Cups, for Travel, Home Office",49.99,4.5,"***Update: I got gifted nicer headphones for my birthday (i.e. $300 more expensive ones), and these are honestly comparable in terms of how much I love them. While the newer ones have better sound quality and have better noise cancellation (which I would hope so due to the price point), in terms of comfort, I like these more. So I will continue to use these for everyday use, especially when on the go, and the other ones for editing and enjoying music and movies at home :) But this is just a testament to how much I like them, and how much I appreciate the price.I bought these about a year ago and came back to write this review. That is how much I enjoy them. These are the only headphones that I find comfortable, have nice sound quality, and are sturdy. Comfort is a big one for me because I wear glasses and find most headphones uncomfortable after a while, but these are the exception. The padding is nice and soft and easy to clean. These are my everyday headphones, and they have withstood a year's worth of going to the gym, playing video games, travel, and listening to music.Noise cancellation is not perfect but good enough to make plane rides tolerable and studying enjoyable, which in the case of 60 dollars, is beyond my expectations. Sound is waaaay better than other competitor headphones I have bought and tried in this price range. I am no audio expert, but there was a noticeable difference, and for an everyday enjoyer of sounds, I was incredibly pleased. Seriously made me regret getting all the headphones I bought before these. They may not be the aesthetic ones you see people use online, but they have done such a great job over the year, and for the price point, I cannot recommend these enough.

"COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare",16.99,4.6,"My daughter actually bought this for herself. She has EXTREMELY sensitive skin (breaks out/rashes with virtually ANY product, especially when it has fragrance), and we have had to use sensitive products with just about everything (soaps, shampoos, laundry detergents, lotions, etc.). Her skin gets pretty dry/flaky/scaly in the winter and red/oily/inflamed in the summer. Well, this past winter her skin was VERY dry, and her friend recommended this product (friend supposedly has sensitive skin as well). So she bought it, and used it (inconsistently though) throughout this past winter. She stated the smell was ok, nice/fresh, but not really descriptive (she couldn't really state, ""it smelled sweet/like flowers/like a perfume/woodsy/earthy/etc.""). She admitted that she could never really get into a routine of using it consistently, but stated that even when she used it one time (and even more when she actually used it several times consecutively) it really made a difference in her skin. She had virtually no dryness, no redness, no flakiness, and no itchiness. She said she would definitely recommend, and without a doubt felt that this would be an excellent product for her if she could just get in the habit of using it consistently (so no negative on the product at all; that is all on her).

"Amazon Basics - 6 Piece Fade Resistant Oversize Bath Towel, Hand and Washcloth Set, 100% Cotton, Navy Blue",19.99,4.5,"These are so nice especially for the price and there large. My hubby thought I spent $30-40 for the set. They were not that fluffy or very soft, just average like $7 Walmart/Target towels but slightly larger but after washing and drying they are softer and fluffier. Perfect! The only negative was they shed but I have a tip that helped a ton. I washed them twice in hot water, they did not fade. After each wash I shook them out really well. After the second wash I put them in the dryer with a fabric sheet for 30 minutes and shook them again after removing from the dryer. I only had one piece of fluff that shook out .. Done. It wasn't as much as the reviews I read or expecting so I'm confused by those reviews. My lint filter wasn't bad either. They are so fluffy and soft now. These are better then the last set I got from Wal-Mart for sure. I've heard the ones that shed extra fluff are the more softer towels but I'm no towel expert so don't quote me on it. I've washed them several times now, they are not shedding now and they haven't faded at all. I bought this and a line of Navy wash cloths by Utopia that faded after one wash and do not look navy any longer. These are great for decorative purposes also since they do not fade.Right now I'm giving them 4 stars to see how they hold up over time and they may possibly receive a 5 stars rating from me. So far I'm pleased. This set absolutely looks like you paid more so I'm surprised by the poor reviews about not being soft, thick etc. They are really the perfect thickness/softness, etc in my opinion. They could be a tad thicker though. These are actually larger then expected which is perfect for me since I love large towels. If you are used to $11-20 a piece luxury towels you may want to rethink these. If you are looking for a good basic towel  ( on the large side) these are for you. I posted pictures..  Both towels,  hand towels and wash cloths just about reach the top of the bottom towel cabinet. I wish Amazon sold sets of like 4 towels, etc. I actually only needed the towels but they didn't have just towel sets.All in all these are perfect as a starter set, off to college, bachelor or for the family. I bought these for my little family of 3 as I just needed a few new towels but I wouldn't hesitate buying another set. They are not small or flimsey and I'm not embarrassed to have family visiting use these. I wouldn't gift them as a wedding gift because I think custom, monogrammed or luxury when it comes to gifts of that nature. I would not mind giving these as a holiday gift if I knew the preferred color or would just choose neutral. All in all I really like them and I've been pretty pleased with most of the things I've purchased from the Amazon Basics branded line as far as price and quality both.

It seems sturdy, and I don't think it looks cheap at all.I'm using it to hold necklaces. I don't wear a lot of traditional silver/gold jewelry. What I wear are handmade 16"" leather chokers with large stone pendants. I have 17 of them, and they fit pretty nicely on this stand--4 or 5 on each half of the two bars.You definitely could fit a lot more traditional jewelry on here, but I like to keep mine spaced out to minimize the stones' clanking against each other when I'm taking one off or putting one back on.I like having a visual display of my necklaces so that I can easily select the one I want to wear. I previously had stored them in a box, and digging through them each time to find the one I wanted was such a hassle. If they had regular silver/gold chains, I'd also have to deal with untangling them. This little stand should prevent that. Just unclasp your necklace or bracelet from the stand, and go!

A friend on Instagram suggested this one and it‚Äôs been amazing. I have used now for several weeks. It goes on clear and you don‚Äôt even feel it. Only drawback is that it‚Äôs expensive.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",41.99,4.3,"Okay,  1 year using and 1 year to learn so as to give a real review,  it's not some 4k ultimate video recording doorbell,  but the video is clear enough and dollar for dollar it might be one of the better 1080 doorbells,  it does have some issues I found work arounds for and some I couldn't,  the reviews you read saying it's very slow to motion alert you are not just hard to please customers,  it is an issue,  It is slow to alert you thru the app on your phone,  why I have not a clue,  the work around is if you have Echo Dot or Echo Show and you know how to set up routines,  have Alexa tell you when that device detects motion,  I found it lightning quick,  why that works faster I don't know,  lol, remember I'm doing honest review on how things worked for me.  I also discovered you can have Echo Show or Echo Dot be your chime so again if you understand Alexa routines,  and you have alexa devices,  you will never have an issue hearing when someone rings your blink Doorbell,  don't forget to link your Blink app and the Alexa app to ensure the above things work for you,  okay on to issue I can't find a work around,  Blinks idea of battery life reminds me of auto manufacturers MPG  estimates,  we all know in the real world it's not going to happen,  sure,  if you dial down all the features,  you might get half of what Blink says,  but then I ask you,  why have it,  we buy them to use them right  ?, so I have found average battery life even using the suggested energizer ultimate lithium,  is about 6 months,  not 2 years  and don't care how they or their paid reviewers try to spin it,  it's not going to happen even if you dial all the features down,  making it a waste of money,  and yes I'm using the sync module which is supposed to help battery life,  maybe it does,  can't answer that but real life,  no B.S. spinning,  your not going to come close to their battery projections,  my only work around for that is the batteries are easy to change and I understand and can deal with this,  Speaking of the Blink module,  I use it for local storage and I also use the pay for cloud storage,  that's another non work around issue,  far far to many features are LOCKED OUT,  if you don't pay for the Blink subscription,  Now if you don't care about saving videos and you just want to know who is at your door regardless if you are home or away,  this will alert you,  it will display to you video of who and allow you to talk to them also and I must say it does a good job at it and you don't need the blink subscription and if you do have the Blink module and a usb stick in, it will save those for you,  at short lengths,  but it will do it.  Overall it is a good security device,  and although obviously it is far from the better ones.  From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this,  , easy to install,  no wires,  pretty much can put it where you want it,  Again it does everything pretty well,  One of the best prices out there,  just understand it has shortcomings,  but also understand it's price,  and it will certainly do the job for you,  this isn't a trashing review,  I  tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it,  it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others,  but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another,  remember,  you can put them about anywhere,  I actually have one stashed at the front of my house,  not by the door,  it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away,  sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not,  weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them,  including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain,  snow and cold,  it has held up well,  still ticking,  no signs of wear,  so another plus

It sounds about the same as my old hairdryer on high, but the low and medium setting is quite quiet. I have long hair and it takes about 15 minutes for me to diffuse it instead of the 30 it took previously. The styling brush tool is great, and I love that they are magnetic.

Once assembled, I was impressed by its sturdy construction and comfortable design. The cushioning is just right, providing a comfortable seating experience for extended periods.The swivel mechanism works smoothly, allowing me to easily move around and access different areas of my workspace.

I have naturally curly hair and the diffuser attachment is great, I can use the high speed, which puts out some serious power, and have no issues with frizz or loss of curl pattern. It sounds about the same as my old hairdryer on high, but the low and medium setting is quite quiet. I have long hair and it takes about 15 minutes for me to diffuse it instead of the 30 it took previously. The styling brush tool is great, and I love that they are magnetic. I don‚Äôt find it to be too heavy, and while it does have some weight on it I‚Äôll take the speed and power over a few extra ounces of weight any day of the week.

"Bride",13.48,4.5,"I get the hype. Y‚Äôall. This book is good. Honestly, fantastic. I really enjoyed reading this one. I‚Äôve enjoyed Ali Hazelwood‚Äôs other works, but this really may be my favorite. This story is hilarious, steamy, and just so entertaining.Bride is a paranormal fantasy/shifter romance mixed in with a mystery. Our fmc is a vampire and mmc a werewolf. A true enemies to lovers type situation, but as we all know, the heart wants what the heart wants. The chemistry between these characters was freaking fantastic. They were written very well and the romance was literally polarizing. The independent journey of discovery that our mc goes through was really really good too.Also, this world is SO interesting and I can forsee Ali Hazelwood doing a lot with it. The side characters were super intriguing and I see a lot of potential for an interconnected series. I love that Ali stayed true to her STEM vibes in this story as well. Though this is her first fantasy, I think she did a stellar job and still made it her own.So anyways, if y‚Äôall are looking for a fantasy romance featuring:‚ú® Enemies to Lovers‚ú® Slow Burn üå∂Ô∏è‚ú® Fated Mates‚ú® Found Family‚ú® Arranged Marriage‚ú® Paranormal Elements‚ú® & a MYSTERYThen I promise, this is the one for you ‚úåüèª

"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain: The Definitive, 4th Edition",15.51,4.7,"Betty Edwards takes you on a journey that is not just about learning how to draw a curve or a shape, but rather deeply psychological and actually plays deeply with mindfulness work, negotiation stuff I'm learning, and more... How you ask? By teaching you how to truly observe what is right in front of you and do your level best to replicate it while leaving the imprint of your own stylish elements as an artist. You are taught how to activate those perceptual centers and get out of your head from those over analytical racing thoughts that run through our minds til your mind focuses what is right in front of you regardless of how you feel about it.It takes you away from ambiguity and paradox to what is.It teaches you how to concentrate on hand and eye moments and to note the nameless shapes and curves rather than the preconceived bias of notions of shapes that affect your ability to replicate.It shows you the psychological truths of how we work in an artistic way to develop perceptual thinking and reduce cognitive dissonance and why for thousands of years artists vs politicians have been that artists will paint what their mind sees no matter how ugly or awful it is or how beautiful or pleasant it is, they just pain what their mind directs them to. It teaches us how to access the deepest recesses of our subconscious til we let go. This is the brilliance of how she presented her drawing lessons.And in just weeks you will go from barely being able to draw to being able to at least do a somewhat realistic portrait although not full on hyperrealismIf you learn this book, it will then be a greater stepping stone to learning hyperrealism from elsewhere

"The Artist's Way Starter Kit",21.49,4.8,"A friend suggested this book ... I am 66 years old and recently retired ... I am on a personal journey to discover my creative self in retirement ...  I am not a painter, or a musician, or any typical what a person would call 'artist'  But I am a creative thinker and now that I am out of over 40 years of Computer IT work I am searching for the creative self within.  I am just completing week one or a 12 week journey .. I am hooked ... It is amazing at how the reading and the daily 3-pages exercise is really helping me to cut right to the core.  If you are a blocked artist of any type.  Or a person that is looking for help to discover the creative artist within ... this might be a good read and personal growth opportunity.

"Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear",11.01,4.5,"The ideas of this book are, of course, nothing new. But as Elizabeth actually puts it, it's her take on living a creative and joyful life. I've read similar ideas from other authors, with different backgrounds, all with their own spins, and I find this one very refreshing. It might seem at times that it's only focused on the creative ""arts"", but this applies to everything.I bought both the Kindle book and the audio since Iike alternating between them. However, the fact that it is narrated by Elizabeth herself made the whole thing much, much better!If anything, this books is a great reminder to not take things so seriously. Enjoy what you do. Stay active. Don't stop making things. Don't let inertia rob you of the precious time we have in this Earth. If you decide to read it, do so with an open mind, and use it to analyze yourself. I don't think anyone cares if you think

"Good Days Start With Gratitude: A 52 Week Guide To Cultivate An Attitude Of Gratitude: Gratitude Journal",6.99,4.6,"I've wanted to keep a gratitude journal for a while, and finally started this year. I was picky about my journal since so many of them seem like gratitude worksheets and have you write down so much about your day, sometimes with a morning and night session. I knew I would never keep something like that up and I was determined to keep going with my journal and that's why I like this one. There's just three lines for each day for you to write a few things you're grateful for. It's one of the last things I do each day and it really helps me slow down and reflect on my day. Even on the days that I'm really tired or that were really long, I know that this journal will only take me a couple minutes to complete so I still sit down to do it. If I purchased one of the more intense gratitude journals, I think I would stop doing it on the first long day.TLDR: Great, simple journal! Especially for the price!! Super easy way to start focusing on gratitude.

"Charmin Ultra Soft Cushiony Touch Toilet Paper, 24 Family Mega Rolls = 123 Regular Rolls",35.49,4.8,"Okay, so I never thought I'd be writing a review for toilet paper, but here we are. Let's talk about Charmin Ultra Soft Cushiony Touch Toilet Paper ‚Äì the toilet paper that actually makes tearing off a sheet kind of fun.First off, let's address the elephant in the room ‚Äì the design it makes when you tear it. There's something oddly satisfying about the clean tear and the neat pattern it creates. I know it's silly, but it's the little things in life, right?But beyond the tearing experience, this toilet paper is actually pretty great. The ultra-soft texture lives up to its name, providing a gentle and comfortable clean every time. It's like a little slice of luxury in an otherwise mundane task.I also appreciate the mega rolls ‚Äì 24 family mega rolls to be exact, which apparently equals 123 regular rolls. That's a lot of toilet paper, which means fewer orders, and who doesn't love that?Overall, Charmin Ultra Soft Cushiony Touch Toilet Paper has won me over with its tear-worthy design and plush feel. It might seem silly to get excited about toilet paper, but hey, when a product delivers on its promises and adds a bit of joy to your day, why not sing its praises?

"Softsoap Liquid Hand Soap, Fresh Breeze - 7.5 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)",7.74,4.8,"This is the only hand soap I will buy and I have used it for years. As the price has gone up, like everything else, I occasionally try to save a little money & will buy something cheaper, but I ALWAYS go back to Softsoap!  And this is the reason why... my skin is very dry & as soon as the weather starts to turn cold, my skin starts cracking & it gets quite painful (working from home, I tend to wash my hands a lot!).  Then one year, I discovered that if I only use this soap, it rarely happens.  This soap is the most moisturizing soap that I've ever found.And it smells delightful.  Every time I place an order on Amazon for anything, I always include a few bottles of this soap!  I love not having to carry the heavy bottles home from the store.  And I 'm so happy to never run out of it either. It tends to last a long time, even with frequent use, so it's a good value!Love this stuff!Highly recommend, especially if you have dry skin.

Otherwise, I cant think of a single fault. The tips last forever and the ergonomics are great and you can always add a grip if needed. The flat side is awesome so it doesn't roll away as easy. The pressure click on the pen is a great feature as well. Love the Apple Pencil 2!

"Handcraft Blends Lavender Essential Oil - 100% Pure and Natural - Premium Grade Essential Oil for Diffuser and Aromatherapy - 0.33 Fl Oz",4.99,4.5,"We recently got mice in our upper garage. I bought this peppermint oil to humanely detract them from living in our garage. I put many, many cotton balls with the peppermint oil, dripping several drops on the cotton balls, throughout the garage. The peppermint oil scent is very strong and spot on. Maybe even a bit overpowering for me, if you stay in the area where the cotton balls are. I put out humane mice traps and within 6 days caught 5 mice. It's been a week and I have not caught anymore mice. It appears they are gone, no longer in the garage, and we haven't gotten anymore ""guests"" in the garage. You do have to reapply the oil to the cotton balls, or whatever, to keep it going, but the scent does last for a while. The oil lasts a long time, the bottle is still over half full, a bargain! Overall I would say the product is a success for detracting mice. I am very happy. Mice got to live in the woods, and we have a mice free garage again.

(Read con below)Cons;-The instructions on using the kickstand (what you see in pictures of product) is VERY WEAK. Any movement of your phone, tapping something on your screen, even with the slightest touch, will cause this to flop back. The magnet that holds it up just does not work. I found to instead fold it into a small triangle into itself, not using the magnet of the flap works best. If you use this horizontally instead though, the intended magnetic flap works fine.-I've had this thing bug out on me where it just stops charging out of nowhere after a minute or two. I have to press the button to reset, or completely remove my phone and re attach for it to work again. My battery can be at any % and this would happen.-It gets WARM.

"Head Strap Compatible with Oculus Quest 3,Meta Quest 3 Accessories Adjustable Elite Strap Replacement for Enhanced Comfort Support and Gaming Immersion in VR",20.73,4.3,"I want to say, the base head strap for the occulus is too loose, it doesnt strap down on the head which means moving also moves the lenses and distorts images as you work. This is unacceptable. Also the weight on the standard strap allows all the pressure of the headset to tilt forward so you'll always feel the strain of the tug on the top and depending on your face, the cheekbones. Very uncomfortable given that the fabric used is textured so it ends up scratching the skin. The elite strap is metas own solution to this but its nearly 70 dollars, thats alot. This is alot cheaper and fixes those issues. It may not be high quality, with plastic inserts, but it does have a few nice things including padding for the back and top and like the elite strap. One thing that the elite does have over this is when you're tired and want to lay down, the elite strap lies flat and this one has a knob that sticks out making this less than ideal for when you want to lay against a wall or have in the bed. But you can tighten very easily and take off very easily too. It also comes with a reflexive hinge design which allows you to secure the headset and align with the eyes, and then strap the rest of the headset to tighten as you slide it back along the head, its a much more intuitive way to seat the headset.  So kudos here to this 3P vendor solution, it may not be perfect, but it is 100% an upgrade for anyone. P.S. there is no universe that the weight of the headset will ever not give you headaches

"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond",63.78,4.6,"Some of us have been practicing software modeling since the early days of Rational Rose (about 20 years ago!) And still we find this business of describing a system's architecture to be vexing. Just give us some rules! Ah, but it's not so simple. Our job as architects and designers is not to just fill out a template. It's to wrap our brains around requirements, ponder solutions, innovate, and sort it all out for ourselves and others. This book feels like modeling 5.0 or something like that. It's an evolutionary next step in the art and craft of communicating software architectures. Paul Clements and team have done a good job of proposing a framework for exploring and communicating designs. It's kind of easy to remember (three views). Yet they recognize that this problem doesn't have a formulaic solution. I might complain that the book doesn't actually work through a complete example--rather, it is rich with tiny examples of each view and style. The comprehensive example is online. Based on personal experience, I might add that this approach needs the support of modern presentation techniques. Audiences--even highly technical ones--may not warm up to a purely views-based presentation. All in all, I highly recommend this book to all software practitioners.

I placed the light bulb in the light fixture and turned on the light fixture. Less than ten seconds later my phone responded and it paired, without my doing anything with the closest Alexa. It totally works and I had to physically do absolutely nothing. I didn‚Äôt even have to activate the phone. Mind you it did not pair with the new Alexa appliance but the Alexa already in the room, which is great. That is what you want it to do. Great! Maybe five seconds to work!

I don't believe in just getting the product and upon first impression doing a review.This printer is heavy so be careful for those that are limited in mobility.  Make sure you watch your back when moving and lifting it.The product is great, I have enjoyed a lot of HP products and also have researched this before I bought it. I liked how others reviewed it with regards to the quality as well as unboxing and it's use.  I am not quite sophisticated with doing the video or shots.Regardless, a few things to take note of....:4. Toners - that come with it are not the heavy usage ones, its enough to do sufficient prints but you'll need to eventually replace - respective to how much color printing you do.  I did purchase 4 toners as replacements as I figured at some point I will need to do replacements and they are extensive.The paper tray is good for about 250 sheets, if you are heavy user you may want to get an update or added paper tray.I have tested scanning and you will need to do a slight adjustment in the scan as sometimes it doesn't get the whole page.Network, works great - however, if you plug it into the computer, it won't be usable on the network unless you have the computer kept on and then reach it going through shared network devices.Color print looks great, I am not printing paintings just color graphics and certain websites and PDFs and documents. It is sufficient - usage of specialized paper could enhance but check for compatibility.This is compatible to work with the mobile HP printing but I have not tested it yet.  It works great for what I need and I am satisfied with it.  I am not a heavy duty user, just when needed I have it available for my use.Connectivity, you can use a USB connector, Ethernet Connector or Wi-Fi.  I prefer hard wire as it is often easier - from my experience.  Be it using USB direct computer or Ethernet.  Wi-Fi works but I love direct hard wired connections.For Faxing you have both the direct line connection for the regular phone RJ connection.  As well as an Out for a phone.Hope that helps anyone reading this review. - Thanks.

"Amazon Basics Smart A19 LED Light Bulb, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, 7.5W (Equivalent to 60W) 800LM, Works with Alexa Only, 1-Pack, Multicolor",12.99,4.5,"Wow, I like these.  I never write reviews.  So I bought echo pop on special, but when you looked down the page certain colors could get a free one of these light bulbs with them.  Sounded great to me.  Then there was a little box where it asked if you wanted it paired with your other appliances and of course yes.  It arrived.  I placed the light bulb in the light fixture and turned on the light fixture.  Less than ten seconds later my phone responded and it paired, without my doing anything with the closest Alexa.  It totally works and I had to physically do absolutely nothing.  I didn‚Äôt even have to activate the phone.  Mind you it did not pair with the new Alexa appliance but the Alexa already in the room, which is great.  That is what you want it to do.  Great!  Maybe five seconds to work!

"Apple iPad (9th Generation): with A13 Bionic chip, 10.2-inch Retina Display, 64GB, Wi-Fi, 12MP front/8MP Back Camera, Touch ID, All-Day Battery Life ‚Äì Space Gray",249,4.8,"It's not just a purchase, It's an investment I should say. For a good price of 270$ you get a great tablet, with great battery, handful of polished software, and latest ipad OS.Evident Pros:The battery life is admirable. In my experience so far, it ocassionaly withstands 2 days before having 17-22% just before I recharge it. Worth to mention however, I don't use it for any mild-heavy gaming.The UI and the OS itself make the tablet a big win for art, study, and partially productivity work. It's very reliable.Nice responsive smooth screen. It's bright, colorful, and the panel is pretty qualitative, and what's important it's fairly repairable, so if you break the front glass it could be easily changed without the need to replace the whole screen.A13 processor. Let's not forget about that. Everything works smooth and fast from UI to the apps themselves.Shots to the overall quality of the product. It's very well-built what makes it feel like a more of a premium product for this money.Cons:The Camera unfortunately is only in the device for the sake of having a camera. If I wouldn't have to, I wouldn't take any photos on this thing. It's too unreliable.Have you seen the bezels of the screen? Having it's crazy specifications for its budget the front screen design makes it look like you bought a tablet from way back in 2016.Apple pen 1st gen. Seriously. Was it that hard to implement apple pen 2nd gen support? Come on apple, you don't even include the pen in the package.Absurd prices on accessories. I won't even care about these, since they cost more than a tablet itself lol

"Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones, 60H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Memory Foam Ear Cups, for Travel, Home Office",49.99,4.5,"TL;DR -- these are the best noise canceling headphones, and they perform at or above the level of more expensive headphones. I tried the newer Q30 version and switched back to these Q20s due to the better performance.I bought these about a year ago, and I've loved them. The noise cancellation is excellent--my sister was showing me the noise cancellation on her new AirPods Max and it was comparable these Q20s. I get easily overwhelmed by lots of noise, so the noise canceling feature was the most important to me when selecting headphones. I use these to block out my husband watching TV, dogs barking, neighbors blasting music in my apartment building, people talking loudly on airplanes, etc. They are excellent, and I can wear them for several hours before my ears start to get a little sore. The battery life on the headphones is also really good. I'm not a huge audiophile so I can't really tell you if the sound quality is as good as more expensive headphones, but I have no complaints about the sound when I'm listening to music.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that I can only connect to one device at a time. If I'm using them for my laptop and I get a call on my phone, I can't take the call on my headset without manually switching the bluetooth connection over. This bothered me enough to try the newer Q30 headphones, which can connect to two devices simultaneously and also have a little feature that switches from noise cancellation mode to transparency mode when you tap the right earphone. After a couple weeks of trying them out, I am returning the Q30s and going back to my Q20s. The newer headphones had less effective noise cancellation, and I would occasionally get a sharp piercing sound in my ear through the headphones that was a little painful. Some of this could be the shape of my ears or whatever, but I found the Q20s to be more comfortable with better noise cancellation, and a much better price point. I can live with the minor inconvenience of the single bluetooth connection in exchange for better noise cancelation.

"COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare",16.99,4.6,"I liked using the retinol! I didn't start out using it very often (like ~1 per week), but my skin seemed to tolerate it well (no irritation, no purging). The bottle is just very small and there's not that much retinol in there. But I think it's a nice 'beginner' retinol if it's something you want to try but don't want to commit to a really expensive/large amount!There is sooo much essence compared to the amount of retinol. It seems moisturizing when you first apply it, but I'm not sure it really added anything substantial to my daily skincare routine. So for these reasons, I think the essence is just fine (relatively cheap, but not a holy grail item). I think my fall/winter moisturizers still did the heavy-lifting when it came to providing all-day or all-night moisture protection to my skin. However, the essence itself is kinda fun. The texture is interesting. Sort of slimy at first but then it rubs in just fine. I do think you still need a moisturizer after applying the essence because there's kind of a weird texture sometimes with the essence (smooth and sort of leftover stickiness? idk, it goes away once I add a normal moisturizer on top). This did not put me off but maybe it'll be an issue for others. I cycle through different skincare routines depending on my skin needs so I'm still trying to get through my 2 bottles! I bought this back in October 2023 and I'm still on my first bottle.

"CeraVe 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 | Face sunscreen With Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide | Hyaluronic Acid + Niacinamide + Ceramides | Oil Free Sunscreen For Face | Travel Size Sunscreen 2.5 oz",13.19,3.9,"I like the rest of Cerave's line up, I use a ton of their other products. Their Skin Renewing Night Cream is probably one of the best moisturizers on the market at this moment and can go toe to toe with some of the big expensive brands you'd find at Sephora. I use their Diabetics Dry Skin Cream all the time and it's positively divine, so much so that I haven't bothered to test out other brands. It's just that good.This? This thing? I genuinely can't believe this is amongst their other products. I read a couple of reviews saying it leaves a white cast and I, looking for a way to make my fair medium skin tone lean more towards the fair end thought ""hey, maybe it will lend me just enough to lighten me up a hair.""No.I only used a tiny dab, not even the full amount you're SUPPOSED to use on your face and not only did it leave me with a white cast but with a blue-ish grey-ish cast that genuinely made me look like I had died about 6 hours ago. UNBELIEVABLY bad cast. And I'm a white person! If that leaves a cast that intense on me, I can't even imagine what kind of cast it would leave on someone darker than me!I get it, this is probably purely a physical sunscreen, its probably all zinc or mineral or something like that in there and the point is that is creates a literal physical barrier so that the uv light can't penetrate through or it bounces off. You can't have a physical barrier without it existing, that's literally impossible. HOWEVER. The fact that it's THAT bad of a blue grey cast??? What are we doing here?????

The wet cloth lays down a liquid, but does not clean it up, which makes it necessary for me to use a floor towel to dry the area cleaned.  (For mopping, my trusty X5 steam cleaner is much more effective.)  I like the heavy duty dry sweeping cloths, but they cost considerably more to replenish; so, for daily cleanups, I prefer to use the dry sweeping cloths.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery | Weather-Resistant Outdoor Camera, Live View, Color Night Vision, Two-way Talk, Motion alerts, Works with Alexa | White",69.99,4.6,"I bought four of these with solar panels. I did have to exchange one camera and one solar panel that did not work correctly. I was immediately shipped replacements and received them within 2 days. The camera that I returned recognized the solar panel was connected but would not charge from the solar panel. The solar panel did not provide power.I have one placed on the front of my 2 story house that the 2nd story blocks direct sunlight. I was concerned this time of year it would not get enough sunlight because the sun is behind the house all day. That is not the case. It charges to 100% even on cloudy days and to 93% on rainy days. I can live with that. So far I‚Äôm impressed, we will see how they hold up and if we start developing issues. If we develop any other issues I will come back and update.I also have all cameras set to the most sensitive motion setting and when a camera or the Ring doorbell senses motion they all start recording until motion is no longer detected. We have no issues with battery life each day.I had zero WiFi connectivity issues and all connections have been stable. We use an Orbi mesh system with 2 satellites.We also use these with an Echo Show 10. When someone rings the doorbell our show instantly shows us the doorbell view and we can immediately communicate with whoever is at the door.I can also tell it to show me any of the other cameras and the echo show instantly shows me that that cameras live view.One word of advice though. It does require a subscription if you want to retain recorded events. The subscription is affordable and for all the available add on options it less expensive than big name monitoring companies. They do now offer monitoring services for this system and it is 1/3 the cost of the big retail company we were using. I advise you to look into all subscription, camera, power, and mounting options before you purchase to make sure it will fit your needs.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",59.99,4.3,"I think that Blink support is great they actually tried to reach out to me when I posted a negative review. So for that effort in them wanting to help I give the company 5 stars. As for the product itself I give 3 stars because it picks up everything even a tree branch on a tree moving. I hate to see what will happen with my blink when a wind storm comes through. Last night it picked up a wolf coming through my yard. With Ring it only picked up people and packages which is what I want a video doorbell to do. I left Ring because of the price hike they did this year. They went from $30 to $49 a yr and I would have paid a small hike and counted it as inflation but that big of a hike and Im gone.I had made a negative feedback originally because I could not get my chime to work. Well I got a professional to come out and fix it and come to find out it was because I just mounted it to the wall and expected it to work but I did not know you also have to go through all the steps in the app to get the chime to work. When I went through all the steps it started working. I would like to get in touch with support again because I cant get the blink doorbell to work with my echo shows like my ring doorbell did

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",59.99,4.3,"Alexa was paired by Amazon with just the blinks. So I bought the two blinks and Alexa, then after that purchase, I  discovered I  had to buy two sync modules, and then two large thumb drives to avoid the monthly cloud fee.  Then I had to buy motion lights because blink does NOT have night vision.  Alexa is cool b8ut she does not show you the blink, she just says motion detected at the blink camera, she doesn't even say if it is the front or back door.  After buying all of this you still have to use your cell to control and use all of it.  Blink has a large view area but they have to be right up on it to make it alert so if your car is parked 25 feet away and someone breaks into it without walking by the door first you are screwed but you can catch your neighbor in a fender bender when someone thinks you hit their car.  So it has true value.

"Amazon Basics Padded Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Adjustable Height/Tilt, 360-Degree Swivel, 275 Pound Capacity, 24 x 24.2 x 34.8 Inches, Black",95.37,4.3,"I work from home and sit at a desk for 6-8 hours per day.  I had a mesh ergo chair for about 3 years, but the seat padding started to wear so needed a replacement.Assembly was about what you would expect from an office chair, anybody that has put an office chair together would have no problem with this one.  All bolts tightened without too much trouble.  Casters attached to the base firmly.  No issues at all with assembly.The seat padding has held up well and is just enough to stay comfortable yet firm on long work days.  The padded arm rests are still like new.  The back padding is soft and cool, no complaints.  It's not terribly ergonomic, but that really wasn't my primary purpose for buying the chair, needed something with good padding and durability.  Padding on arms, back, and seat has not faded at all.The pneumatic lever controls height, no problem with it staying at same height all the time (previous chairs of mine would creep up in height every few days and would have to re-adjust).  Tilt works as expected, allows for leaning back just enough but not enough to make you feel like you're falling backward!  Chair is on carpet and I don't use a chair mat...  Chair rolls easily on carpet.Overall, great chair and would buy again.

This dries my hair super fast. It has different attachments, but I don't use those. I have my own routine. After I dry my hair, I use a brush blow dryer to give it more of a straight look. There is the attachment to do that with this dryer, but I can't seem to get the hang of it. The dryer is a bit heavy, but for a quick dry, it definitely does the job.

"Amazon Fire TV 32"" 2-Series HD smart TV with Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote, stream live TV without cable",119.99,4.5,"I needed a tv for my bedroom & this one fits the bill.  It was very easy to set up with my echo devices & it's great to set it up to go to a specific streaming app as soon as it turns on. The only complaint would be, when there's a power outage & the power's back on, you'll have to first turn the tv back on in order for it to connect to your wifi again but that's not a major issue.The speakers seem good to me. I'm no expert but they're better than the ones that I have installed in my living room tv.  The remote control is easy to use but I would love if all companies would put some ridges on the remote controls that come with tv sets these days.  They're so smooth the remote can easily slip through your fingers.All in all, I think this tv is a good purchase and a fair price for the size and features.

"Say You'll Be Mine: A Novel",13.15,4.2,"This book was an interesting romance that wasn't really a romance...or was it. It was based on families from India and I learned a lot about Indian food and customs. Both of the main characters were straddling the fence between being Indian and following their customs or being American which was made more difficult by two sets of parents who believed in things like arranged marriages and a strong work ethic.Meghna's parents wanted her to be an engineer - something that her mother continued to bring up every chance she got. Meghna wanted to be a teacher and eventually a playwright - professions that her parents didn't think highly of. When she finds out that her writing partner and best friend from college is engaged to be married, she is devastated. Seth never realized what a crush Meghna had on him but he continued to keep in touch with her over the years because she always had good suggestions about the songs he was writing. She decides that it's time to get on with her life and allows her parents to set up a meeting with a potential suitor - something that can lead to an arranged meeting. She's very unimpressed with Karthik who tells her that he has no intention of ever getting married but was letting his mom set up matchmaking meetings to make her happy. After they meet the first time, he calls her and asks her to go along with a fake engagement between the two of them. This will make his mother quit matchmaking and for her, she'll have a plus one for Seth's wedding. The more time they spend together, the more they begin to rely on each other. Is there a chance that the fake engagement will become real or will their initial impressions keep them apart?I really enjoyed this romance. Both Meghna and Karthik knew what they wanted out of life. She wanted Seth and a happily ever after and Karthik wanted to remain single after living through the kind of marriage that his parents had. Every time it seemed that they may be falling in love, a disagreement or a remark pushed them away from each other again. I loved the way their relationship evolved from strangers to lovers with lots of growth for both of them along the way.This is a debut novel by Naina Kumar and based on this novel I look forward to her future books.

Please note the workbook includes the same weekly questions as the book. It is merely giving you a way to journal your answers/thoughts. When I did the book years ago, I used a plain notebook. That worked just fine, BUT I like the workbook better. It is easier to see your answers, and note your own journey.The paper is newsprint. It is not fancy, very lightweight. I thought I would hate the feel, but I am okay as long as I use pencil, not pens. The paper is not lined. I liked this. One day, as I saw the shadow of my hand, I drew my hand. I would not have done this if the workbook had lines.

"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain: The Definitive, 4th Edition",15.51,4.7,"This book definitely deserves five stars! I've read it before and I didn't know it. Funny story: I had this book several years ago,  and I just assumed that this would be a recent version or edition. I don't have that book handy ‚Äì the first one ‚Äì because I have moved to a smaller place and it is in storage. So funny me - I bought the version I already had before so I could compare it with this supposed newer version? So I thought.  Well because the link didn't work to go to the Amazon page where  this book is located, and since I saw no reviews on what I thought was the older book's page, I now have three copies of the same book  ha ha. It's just as well because this book makes a perfect gift for anyone starting out in the art world. Drawing skills are a  essentials, and they come before anyone even thinks of doing any painting. I think that is why a book like this,  covering a method of drawing as with right brain and left brain to learn the basics and the tricks of drawing well, would be such a complicated book.  I've rarely seen a painting book that is this detailed.  I do have them, I would like to find them, because attention to detail ‚Äì as with drawing and painting hands ‚Äì is so  important and difficult to learn for the first time.I've been in and out of the art scene for over 25 years, and I am not what I would consider an artist. However, because of books like this, (and videos) I merrily walked into a watercolor class for the first time the other day and painted better than almost anyone in the class. It really surprised me. I took informal classes for six months about 3 years ago - at a YMCA where a member who is an artist and teacher decided to teach in a spare room.  She was really rude to me haha but I did learn some, just nothing like what I just painted.  I've only have the basics of training. Most of my expertise is in Photoshop. In Photoshop the are tools for perspective and symmetry. Just reading this book as a review has refreshed my memory about my drawing days. I think it is an important distinction to make that I am doing digital art most of the time anyway. Somehow, book and video learning in traditional drawing and painting has helped me translate skills into digital painting. Not so with digital painting books I have read where it is assumed you need to learn the software from the very beginning, but still assume you are already a painter.  Learning the drawing must come first, so I've been told.  Though I don't have any formal training in drawing or painting, and I've really studied about and practiced painting AND drawing at the same time, books such as this one are so handy to have so we can review the basics along with the added concept of left versus right brain thinking regarding drawing skills.So for me, it is more of a reference, and I highly recommend this book as a gift to a young person just starting out in the art world.  It is a precious classic for a reason. The techniques  are solid and classical. This book covers drawing from so many different perspectives that I find it hard to believe anyone would read this, practice with this book, and come away empty-handed. In fact, I would expect the best of results of course varying from person to person.Classical artists have been using most of these techniques for thousands of years. The right brain left brain drawing concept isn't new because this author has been writing updates and additions on this book for many years. I'd be surprised if many artists are not familiar with it.I get the feeling that this is an underutilized gem.  And I am happy to review it ‚Äì again ‚Äì ha ha :-).I have a new grandbaby, as my very mature son just had his first child. You can bet that she will get all of my art books. And her mother, already likes this one, because she gave a copy to me years ago. Instinctively, I was able to draw from the get-go, but to do it well ‚Äì I have seen very few people accomplish that without some instruction. We are talking about perspective, composition, negative space,  positive space, drawing with grids, using pencils and other tools for measurement when doing what I would consider to be live drawing, and more. So many people these days use photos as reference; and even then, one can benefit from the good old grid.  There aren't too many projects in this book really, unless you decide that you want to practice after every lesson or chapter. This is the way to really get value here.I can still use this book right now, because in painting I am having trouble with foreshortening, which is drawing something at certain angles in perspective where the front needs to be drawn differently from the part farthest away, and you can only draw what you see as if it is the front of my hand in front of my other fingers and so on - as I understand it. I could never afford, nor could I manage a fine art degree,  but darn it, I am doing pretty well just the same.The reason why I am not explaining the left brain right brain concept. which is the cornerstone of this book, is because for me it is very confusing. I get dyslexia every time I try to think about the different brain hemispheres.  So please don't get me wrong; I am not discounting this sort of learning concept; I am simply saying that this book is just great on its own merits despite my not being able to understand the ""different from the norm"" concept within this particular classic.This book is very well diagramed, and much can be learned by looking at images/drawings; for example, a drawing of the ocean, showing how the ripples are smaller and closer together as they recede up to the horizon line;  just as when I am challenged with a landscape, it helps to know the relationship between one part and the other, since I didn't grow up observing so well how nature works.  Most artists I've talked to have been observing nature in a detailed and specific way most of their lives. This is not to say that no one will not be able to learn how to draw or paint really well instinctively, but it is rare.  I am saying this to demonstrate how important it is to know these concepts from a book like this to get familiar with them. Or to just be introduced to them.I am just as pleased to have a reunion with this book as I was to find that after three years of not painting with watercolor, I was able to do a landscape very well in watercolor when I didn't ever learn to before . Highly recommended.

"Pretty Simple Lettering: A Step-by-Step Hand Lettering and Modern Calligraphy Workbook for Beginners (Premium Spiral-Bound Hardcover)",19.99,4.6,"This book is a nice intro into hand lettering and calligraphy. I primarily bought it to learn calligraphy basics to write letters.  It gives a good description of the different tools, bands, and techniques. It offers four different fonts to practice with some room on each page to do so. Realistically, to practice further you will have to either buy lined paper or make it yourself. I do wish there were other fonts to choose from as these aren‚Äôt really my style. Most of the projects in here focus on hand lettering and not calligraphy, which is why I bought it. After learning a few strokes and letters I quickly moved on to writing letters for practice rather than doing any of the hand lettering projects included.

"Charmin Ultra Soft Cushiony Touch Toilet Paper, 24 Family Mega Rolls = 123 Regular Rolls",35.49,4.8,"I never thought I would be writing a review for toilet paper. I never really thought about the design of toilet paper when tearing it off of a roll until I saw the wavy smooth tear. When I saw it, I had to try it.When I received the package, I was eager to try it out. I chuckled to myself for getting a little excited about a different way of tearing toilet paper.So far I have had perfect tears every time. No more unsightly uneven sheets.  It seems no more wasting paper. The scalloped edge looks better than a straight tear hanging from the roll.Kudos to the design team at Procter and Gamble for making simple, simpler. It is nice to see someone come up with a novel idea without a list of instructions.I have used Charmin ever since I can remember, but I must admit that I have purchased other brands to save money.  But I have always come back to Charmin.In my opinion,  Charmin is the softest, strongest and most absorbent toilet paper on the market. I don't mind spending a little more money for the great feel it gives my skin.It's a good thing to want to treat yourself to the best. If you haven't used Charmin before, give it a try.

"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond",63.78,4.6,"This is an exceptionally well-written book, and I'm glad to have it in my library. It gives thorough and detailed advice, with plenty of sidebars and cross references. The book has a URL to a website that presents an architectural description that embodies many of the recommendations from the book. There were some areas where the book fell short of what I was looking for guidance on: (1) the intersection of the requirements document and the architecture document; (2) the intersection the architecture document and the detailed design specification; (3) where & how interaction scenarios are documented (the book does mention use cases and includes them in a view in the example architecture document). Still, the book covers so much so well. If you have an interest in creating software architecture documents, I highly recommend this book.

"SHARK HyperAir IQ Hair Dryer Ultra-Fast Drying. No Heat Damage. Styles That Last. (Black) (Renewed) 1.0 Count",109.99,4.4,"I have really thick, wavy hair that normally takes me half an hour to blow dry. I don't like air drying because I usually get sick and my hair is crazy after. This dries my hair super fast. It has different attachments, but I don't use those. I have my own routine. After I dry my hair, I use a brush blow dryer to give it more of a straight look. There is the attachment to do that with this dryer, but I can't seem to get the hang of it. The dryer is a bit heavy, but for a quick dry, it definitely does the job.

So had to buy a new iPad. With all the good reviews I decided on this one. Set up was easy, battery lasts a long time. Colors are bright, screen clear, functions perfectly. Everything transferred from my iPhone as my iPad Pro was deader than dead. But I found one of my game apps did not come over. And of course it was my favorite. Took me awhile to find a similar game by the same brand. Not exactly the same but close. Other than that, no complaints. Happy with this purchase.

"Stevia In The Raw, Plant Based Zero Calorie, No Erythritol, Sugar Substitute, Sugar-Free Sweetener for Coffee, Hot & Cold Drinks, Suitable For Diabetics, Vegan, Gluten-Free, 200 Count Packets (1 Pack)",11.26,4.6,"Disclaimer - I don't have diabetes, so some of the information here doesn't affect me directly, but is more for full transparency...I love stevia and leverage it more than any other sweetener, it holds a much lower risk than other sweeteners, health-wise. However, Stevia in the Raw has a filler - maltodextrin. Maltodextrin has a higher glycemic index than regular table sugar. So while it's true that this is likely a better alternative that pure sugar - maltodextrin itself is highly processed and refined and carries significant other risks, still tied to potential diabetic risks (and can lead to type 2 diabetes, itself).So if you need a stevia-ONLY sweetener, you may want to consider an alternative brand such as Pyure, who does not use filler in their powder, or possible liquid extracts (also available from companies like Pyure) which may have other ingredients but are typically low-risk, such as citric acid.Overall 4/5 because the taste and function is great. It dissolves well in both cold and hot liquids, and I've only baked with it once, but it turned out fine. The removal of the star is simply for the mis-leading branding and labeling.Traveling only gets 3/5 stars because this would require re-packaging to travel with a smaller portion. For better travel, I'd recommend exploring either a fluid/extract, or the Stevia in the Raw brand individual packets.

"Amazon Basics - 6 Piece Fade Resistant Oversize Bath Towel, Hand and Washcloth Set, 100% Cotton, Navy Blue",19.99,4.5,"I bought these hand towels only to use until bath renovations occur in the near future, not planning to use them forever. These hand towels are washed several times a week in hot water, on our washer's heavy duty wash setting and dried on high. I've had them for a few months and they look brand new. Unlike the big name brand towel sets we initially bought, the decorative band towards the ends did not shrink, making the towel a weird shape. It stayed the same size, with no frays and minimal, if any, shrinkage. I cannot comment on color fastness, although I will say my towels are still bright white, even after being smeared with make-up. The towels don't seem to hold stains. I'm sensitive to odors and these do not have or retain any weird odors. I will say that anything that survives me (I am rough on everything), has to be made of really good stock. What was initially meant to be good enough for now looks like the brand I will try after renovations finally take place. Would definitely recommend.

"Amazon Basics Tritan BPA-Free Plastic Stemless Wine Glass, 14-Ounce, Clear - Set of 4",26.48,4.5,"I was given a gift basket with a bottle of wine and one of these glasses in it.  I thought it was real glass until unwrapped the basket, and I was surprised at how cool the wine glass was.  It is larger than a wine glass, so you can put an iced drink in this as well and its the perfect size...iced tea, sodas, spritzers, and regular wine with a mom-sized pour :)  I normally don't like drinking out of plastic, but for some reason I don't mind this glass...maybe it's because it still fits nicely in my hand (I have arthritis, so the lightweight ""glass"" fits comfortably in my hand).  These would be perfect for around the pool, or in our case, on the river.  We often host parties at our house and we all sit in our lawn chairs in the river(yes, IN the river)...and I always used to cringe when anyone would try to take glass out onto the river....so these will be perfect for that.  I immediately went online and ordered 2 sets of these, and my husband and I have been using them quite often...even when we are hanging around inside the house.  I usually host a ""mom"" party and the moms can get pretty wild...so I will definitely be using these ""glasses"" for that.  I would only hand wash these, and would not use the scrubby part of the sponge or your glasses could become cloudy.  So far, ours have remained clear with delicate washings and daily use and I've had them since April.  If you are on the fence, order a set just to try out...for the price, it's totally worth the try.Get a set for your camper, your picnic basket or for those clumsy friends that come over for drinks :)  Cheers!

"Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen - SPF 40-1.7 fl oz - Invisible, Broad Spectrum Face Sunscreen - Weightless, Scentless, and Oil Free - For All Skin Types and Skin Tones",38,4.6,"I have finally found the holy grail of sunscreens! As someone with acne-prone skin, finding a sunscreen that doesn't cause breakouts has been a never-ending struggle. But the Supergood Unseen Sunscreen has completely changed the game for me.First and foremost, this sunscreen lives up to its name. It's truly invisible, weightless, and scentless. The comprehensive protection it offers against blue light, UVA, and UVB rays gives me peace of mind knowing that my skin is shielded from potential damage caused by my phone, computer, and tablet. Blue light damage is usually caused by electronic devices and highly overlooked and can make hyperpigmentation worse.What sets this sunscreen apart from others is its ability to double as a fantastic makeup primer. The oil free formula controlling shine and leaving a velvety finish that makes my makeup last all day. It's like a two-in-one product that saves me time and money. It also has a great feeling/finish wearing it on its own.Now, I must address the price. Yes, it is on the higher side, but let me tell you, it's worth every penny. However, if you're on a budget, Trader Joe's has a great dupe for around $9 that feels very similar. But personally, I'm willing to invest in a product that not only protects my skin but also enhances my makeup application.

"SHARK HyperAir IQ Hair Dryer Ultra-Fast Drying. No Heat Damage. Styles That Last. (Black) (Renewed) 1.0 Count",119.95,4.4,"I am very impressed with this hair dryer. I have curly hair so I used the diffuser attachment. I also have the curl types (2C with alittle bit of 3A) that is most prone to heat damage. I was very impressed with how this dryer worked. It‚Äôs very powerful on the highest setting! Most diffusers don‚Äôt dry my hair so quickly and they leave hot spots on my scalp and only hold my curls for about 2, maybe 3 days but not this one. Even after I pull my hair up, do an intense workout, or mess it up, I just spray a little water on it and it bounces back immediately. Also I noticed that my hair care products work so much better with this diffuser. My hair is softer, shinier, looks much healthier and my curls are more defined. My son who has type 3C/4A hair also loves this hairdryer. We were so pleased we decided to buy one for my son‚Äôs girlfriend who also has curly hair. Some reviews on here say that the dryer gets ‚Äútoo hot.‚Äù That is not true. It is made of high quality materials and the ceramic does not cause hot spots or heat damage. The only thing is that it‚Äôs not exactly in ‚ÄúExcellent Condition‚Äù but more of a ‚Äúused‚Äù condition. Nevertheless I still recommend this hairdryer especially if you have curly or wavy hair and don‚Äôt mind having a used hairdryer.

"Amazon Basics Padded Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Adjustable Height/Tilt, 360-Degree Swivel, 275 Pound Capacity, 24 x 24.2 x 34.8 Inches, Black",95.37,4.3,"I'll admit that when I bought this chair I didn't even pay attention to the fact that it said ""AmazonBasics"" in the title.  But as it turns out, Amazing must have contracted some Chinese company to build them stuff in their name.  And as such, you can bet that the quailty of the item will actually be rather good.  Why would Amazon put their name on garbage?This chair is a fantastic value.  It was easy to put together, came with an Allen key and all if the hardware was in small, separate baggies that were labeled and the instructions were very well written and very easy to understand.  I had the chair together in under ten minutes while moving at a leisurely pace.  On top of this, the bolts came with blue thread locker already on them.  I know that isn't a huge deal to most people, but it means something to me.  It shows they want you to have this thing in one piece for a long time.The chair looks and feels like something you'd have in a professional office.  The faux leather is well made and quite comfortable.  The adjustment on it works very well and over all, the chair feels like it should cost much closer to the $100 mark.Make no mistake, this isnt some $300 chair, but at the same time, it isn't trying to be.  I basically bought this thing to sit in front of our computer that we almost never use.  So, in reality, I almost bought it just to complete my office.  So, if you have a home office and want a chair that's very comfortable, looks good but don't care about the lack of head rest and don't want to break the bank, this is the one.I actually work in front of a computer all day long, and this is a chair I wouldn't mind having there.  I'd probably miss the head rest after a bit, but this is something I would use in a professional setting.

"Amazon Basics Classic Puresoft PU Padded Mid-Back Office Computer Desk Chair with Armrest, 26""D x 23.75""W x 42""H, Black",95.73,4.2,"This chair is to replace an older chair that had simply worn out over a span of about 15 years of use. I was looking for a quick, budget minded replacement and then will spend probably weeks looking at a higher quality chair, with full high back. At this price, I was not expecting a high quality chair, and that is what I got. It is more or less easy to assemble. It can be a bit tricky when assembling the arm rest. I loosely attached the back two bolts, then the seat. I did the same on the other side, and then tightened them in sequence : Outer back and outer seat bolts, then inner back and inner seat screws. The threads on the back and seat frame are pre-machined but with very little tolerance so you need to be careful not strip them out if you start them at even just a slightly off-angle. Assembling the base and height adjustment assembly went much easier. The chair has a metal inner frame, and base is also metal (there is some wood on the inside sides of the back and perhaps inside the seat). There is some plastic in the base assembly, but that is only cosmetic. Armrest frames are plastic as well.  I also replaced the wheels with higher grade wheels I already had on hand (these have a slightly wider tread as well as slightly larger diameter). Finally I went back through and retightened all the screws, taking care not to overtighten. Assembly completion from opening the box to final check was about 30 minutes.The faux leather covering is what you would expect in a chair at this price range. The seat padding is very firm (too firm?) but not uncomfortable for me, but will have to see how it feels after a long session at my computer. The biggest disappointment is the nearly hollow back with NO filling or padding (this is where the parts are stored when shipped). Very little to no support! I had a large bag of batting I was going to use for another project in the near future but decided to stuff it into the back (the bottom has a zipper ... remember, this is where the parts were stored). I took care to install the batting evenly, taking care not to overstuff. It made a big difference.  The other disappointment was that, although listed as a mid-back chair, it is just barely that. Many other chairs (higher price) typically have at least a 24"" inside back length for a mid-size chair back, as measured from the top of the seat ... this one is 22"" The seat depth could have been maybe and inch deeper, as many chairs at this price have (this chair at 17.75"" is barely enough). I am 5'11"" and wight about 190 lbs. If you are taller or heavier, this chair might not work well for you. (My daughter, who is medium build at 5' 7"" thought it was comfortable for her). So here is my summary:PRO: Good price. Seems to be sturdy enough with full metal frame and base. Assembly a bit tricky but just need to be patient and have good lighting.CONS: Seat depth a bit too short. Back offers little to no support without some fill (DIY).So overall, this will do until I can spend some time to look at chairs in person, with better overall quality.

"SHARK HyperAir IQ Hair Dryer Ultra-Fast Drying. No Heat Damage. Styles That Last. (Black) (Renewed) 1.0 Count",109.99,4.4,"I am very impressed with this hair dryer. I have curly hair so I used the diffuser attachment. I also have the curl types (2C with alittle bit of 3A) that is most prone to heat damage. I was very impressed with how this dryer worked. It‚Äôs very powerful on the highest setting! Most diffusers don‚Äôt dry my hair so quickly and they leave hot spots on my scalp and only hold my curls for about 2, maybe 3 days but not this one. Even after I pull my hair up, do an intense workout, or mess it up, I just spray a little water on it and it bounces back immediately. Also I noticed that my hair care products work so much better with this diffuser. My hair is softer, shinier, looks much healthier and my curls are more defined. My son who has type 3C/4A hair also loves this hairdryer. We were so pleased we decided to buy one for my son‚Äôs girlfriend who also has curly hair. Some reviews on here say that the dryer gets ‚Äútoo hot.‚Äù That is not true. It is made of high quality materials and the ceramic does not cause hot spots or heat damage. The only thing is that it‚Äôs not exactly in ‚ÄúExcellent Condition‚Äù but more of a ‚Äúused‚Äù condition. Nevertheless I still recommend this hairdryer especially if you have curly or wavy hair and don‚Äôt mind having a used hairdryer.

"Say You'll Be Mine: A Novel",13.15,4.2,"This book is romance all the way!  Elementary teacher Meghna Raman‚Äôs Indian parents want their daughter to marry. Halfway across the country, New Yorker Karthik Murthy‚Äôs Indian mother wants her engineer son to marry. Neither family knows the other. Meghna is still in love with her college sweetheart who is soon to be married to the lovely Julie, a singer songwriter. Karthik has sworn off ever marrying because, above all else, he is fearful he will become cruel and domineering like his father. Karthik senses a rage boiling deep inside himself.Through the Indian-arranged-marriage-grapevine both Meghna and Karthik end up in Meghna‚Äôs parents home in a culturally rich meeting for their arranged marriage. Both Karthik and Meghna agree to fake an engagement for different reasons. For Karthik, an engagement will stop the multi weekly visits to different homes searching for the right girl and for Meghna, she would have her plus one for ex boyfriends‚Äôs wedding.As the fake engaged couple navigate family and social events and the wedding activities, their lack of communication drove me crazy. I wanted to pull my hair out! Just talk to each other!  But, then the excitement and sexual tension would be absent and we would be reading a short story.Sub plots of family concerns, job woes, and a few surprises work well in fleshing out the story. Overall, a predictable romance with the reader having a few pauses that just maybe the results might not be as easily predicted as thought. A three star read for me.

"Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear",11.01,4.5,"Honestly, there's nothing revolutionary in this book as far as what Gilbert is saying. She hasn't found some magical new formula for unlocking your creativity. Instead, what she has done is create a dialog, as if you were sitting down to coffee with a friend and confessing that you really wanted to be creative but... Gilbert deals with the variety of things that could follow that ""but"", and she pulls apart each and every one.Will everyone appreciate this book? Probably not. Gilbert does slay some pretty sacred cows, including the notion of the ""tortured"" artist, but I think she makes a very compelling case for all the cows she slays. The bottom line of this book, really, is do you want to be a creative person because you want the sense of accomplishment and transcendence that creativity can inspire, or do you want to be a creative person because you're hoping to make millions and be lauded by the masses? If it's the second, Gilbert basically tells you that you need not apply, and I agree with her. Creativity may pay off monetarily or in the form of social approbation, or it may not, but if all you really want is to create, who cares? Gilbert holds up all the fears that commonly hold people back and says, ""So what?""While I'm not a religious person, I got where she was going by likening creativity to a sort of religious calling. As she says, she doesn't advocate for people moving out to a mountain and living a life of solitary devotion to creativity--unless that's your thing, in which case you should do it. Instead, she's advocating for creativity as a form of not just self-expression, but as a way for people to make something beautiful solely for the sake of making something beautiful. As she says, it's both essential and non-essential. At heart, I think that's what makes us human: that we create things that aren't necessary merely because we like the look of them, or the sound of them, or the taste of them, or the way they feel when we wear them. It's in the act of creating--even if our creation is bad or misunderstood or unloved--that we are able to get outside of our own heads for a bit. We can forget about our mundane worries and struggles and we can experience moments of pure joy.Not that she's saying that all this can come about without some fear and struggle and some sense of pain. What she advises is that we learn to live with these things without allowing them to control us. I know this seems simplistic, but she does such a great job of laying out how to avoid being controlled by your fears. What she's revealing here is that what holds most people back is themselves. What does it matter if people dismiss your creativity or think you're strange? The best kind of creativity, Gilbert says, is the kind that's done entirely because *you* want to do it, not because you're trying to appeal to the masses. The Big Magic, really, is experiencing the joys of creativity for yourself and not for some nebulous, unknown consumer market. If you're fortunate, the market may follow. If not, it won't. Either way, you'll have created something and will have the pride of knowing that it's yours. And when you're done, you'll let it loose, acknowledge that it may not be perfect, and go on to make something else. You can do all this with a sense of awe that you're doing something that fulfills a need deep within yourself. It won't feed you or clothe you or put a roof over your head (unless your creative outlet is something like farming or weaving or carpentry, in which case you may well fulfill some of these essential needs as well), but it will provide you with experiences that you can hoard like treasures, to be pulled out and admired and marveled at whenever you so desire.Reading this book was so good for me because it helped me to see how counterproductive some of the nagging voices in the back of my head are. It encouraged me to take creative leaps and to be philosophical when those leaps sometimes fail, as they inevitably will. Gilbert has helped me to see that, no matter what, I will always long for that creative outlet, so why bother denying it to myself? I can engage with it for the pure joy of engaging with it, and if anything else comes of it, great. If not, well, I'll have been living the life I want to live, and that really counts for more than anything else.

Also I noticed that my hair care products work so much better with this diffuser. My hair is softer, shinier, looks much healthier and my curls are more defined. My son who has type 3C/4A hair also loves this hairdryer. We were so pleased we decided to buy one for my son‚Äôs girlfriend who also has curly hair. Some reviews on here say that the dryer gets ‚Äútoo hot.‚Äù That is not true. It is made of high quality materials and the ceramic does not cause hot spots or heat damage. The only thing is that it‚Äôs not exactly in ‚ÄúExcellent Condition‚Äù but more of a ‚Äúused‚Äù condition. Nevertheless I still recommend this hairdryer especially if you have curly or wavy hair and don‚Äôt mind having a used hairdryer.

If you are using a stapler in your business and just doing the receipt to the invoice, I highly recommend these, and even if it is for a little more than just that, these staplers feel like they will hold up to more than one tax season.

"Amazon Fire TV Stick, HD, sharp picture quality, fast streaming, free & live TV, Alexa Voice Remote with TV controls",43.83,4.7,"I just regret not having reacted earlier and bought my Amazon fire stick a long time ago, instead of paying for a cable subscription unnecessarily. The HD picture quality is sharp crisp and despite response to the commands not being as fast as cable (showing some micro-second slags with the remote) that seems to be only a very minor inconvenience, almost unnoticeable. You will get a stable signal as long as your internet service enjoys a reliable connection as well. The set up was a breeze and very straightforward and I love the minimalist design parameters of the remote, very sleek and intuitive and all you need at a simple click of your fingertips. There is obviously a learning curve into changing to full streaming services but is more about the learning experience to navigate the app and getting acquainted with the remote, getting familiar with the apps you‚Äôd like to keep and avoid getting lured into acquiring new pay streaming services unnecessary for your needs or preferences. Beware, the current streaming offer seems to be enormous, so I can see it might take you some time just organizing your preferences.The fire TV will let you organize access into separate user profiles and establishing parental controls or limited access accordingly. Overall, it proves to be a simple solution for quality streaming services at a very convenient price and a definite good bye to my regrets for paying expensive cable tv services!

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"I was stunned at how much better the picture quality is with this device vs the built in Samsung apps. I get consistent HDR quality streaming apps. I tested this by running the movie Interstellar on Amazon prime in the built in Samsung prime app and then flipped to this Amazon fire stick. Not only did the picture quality look better but the HDR worked (whereas it didn't in the built in Samsung prime app). Additionally it completely takes over your TV and soundbar with one remote. Finally it's lightening fast and you don't have to wait for your TV smart apps to load (most TVs have very slow processors and are sluggish especially when you first turn it on) , the fire stick loads things at lightening speeds even after pressing the power to turn it on.  Love it! 5 stars.

"GTPLAYER Gaming Chair, Computer Chair with Footrest and Lumbar Support, Height Adjustable Game Chair with 360¬∞-Swivel Seat and Headrest and for Office or Gaming (Faux Leather, Red)",43.83,4.4,"Love it. I'm not good at asymbeling and this was super easy. Just do one step At a time and read the notes per step. Last gamer chair I had was a titan secret lab  and this was as comfy as that. The armbars don't move but that wasn't a problem for me.the footrest is just a easy sliding bar that doesn't really extend to far but still worked for me. The headrest is OK but is not luxury comfort. Having said all that for the money and ease of setup it's a great deal for under $200. The chair is really comfortable the recliner steadily stops at several recline positions. If you knew what you were doing 100 percent you could set this chair up I'm 10 minutes but with reading it's probably a 40 minute setup. When you connect the top to the bottom there is a slot at the bottom the top fits in so you can easily screw the screws in with one person. No extra tools required or needed. While it's not premium luxury it is a really really comfortable chair and even has a massager that uses USB. Its not super strong but it does a good job. Only complaint it's a little loud but not deafening. If your looking to spend under 200 and need a one person setup I highly recommend this chair! Delivery was also fast! It's a little intimidating when first opening but the directions were fairly easy to follow. Had a few extra screws in the end but I think they are just backups. Just buy it lol.

"Gaming Chair, Ergonomic PC Chair, Home Office Chair with footrest, Racing Computer Chair Reclining Game Chair for Adults, 330lbs Heavy Duty, Leath-Aire Fabric (Black2)",43.83,4,"I'll come back and add a photo later (using my desktop to write this). My husband's computer chair has been peeling and losing its padding for a while now - as a 7-year-old chair will do - but replacing it wasn't at the top of his list. I decided to make this a Christmas gift, and it's absolutely perfect. I was wary of buying a gaming chair because he's always owned traditional executive-style chairs and has never mentioned wanting anything different. After reading several reviews mentioning this exact concern and the consumers' being pleasantly surprised by the comfort and support, I took the leap. They were right! Initially, my husband was worried the neck rest would be annoying, but it wound up being more helpful than the vibrating back pad (no complaints with it - it just isn't the star of the show). The tilt goes wayyyyy back. You could nap in this thing! Assembly was not difficult; most of the screws were already in place. One person can easily handle it alone.  Shortly after assembly, he sat down, made his adjustments, and spent about 2 hours testing it out. He was comfortable the entire time and didn't feel stiff upon standing.The only con so far: the pivoting arm rests are very loose, meaning they wobble. It isn't really a functional concern, but it is slightly annoying, especially if you bump them during intense gameplay.Overall, VERY pleasantly surprised by and optimistic about this purchase!

"NEO CHAIR Office Chair Computer Desk Chair Gaming - Ergonomic High Back Cushion Lumbar Support with Wheels Comfortable Ivory Leather Racing Seat Adjustable Swivel Rolling Home Executive",43.83,4.2,"So I put this chair together about an hour ago and I've got to say...I'm impressed for the price. I read the reviews and was hesitant, but went through with the purchase.Assembly was easy and took me about 30 minutes from cutting the box open. ---The legs seam solid and sturdy; When assembling them the legs were tight and stiff before screwing in, so it seems like a solid base. ---Decent quality wheels (I'm on low-mid height carpet, can't comment on wood/vinyl/tile noise). --- the plastic arms do seem thick and solid enough, but I could see how, over time, outwards pressure could make them snap. That's not how I sit, so no issue for me. --- I saw a few pictures of the metal under the seat breaking, but it seams thick enough for me. If you're pushing that 300 lb limit, maybe it'll go over time. I'm only 160 lb. --- no squeaking or any sort of noise when moving around. --- Initial thoughts on comfort: the chair feels and is shaped comfortably. I'm 6'2"" and did not expect to be able to rest my head back. I can't, as expected. Cushions are somewhat stiff (expected when new), but still very comfortable. I know it will break in some over time. Arm padding is nice, but I think it could be a tad bit thicker. Mine don't look as this as they do in the photos.overall, very happy right off the bat. Besides one indentation in the leather (which will come out in a little time), no damage or broken pieces at all. I will update this review in the future, once I've actually put some use into the chair. -Would recommend for this price range, based off my initial thoughts.(2 MONTHS OF USE) - I've had the chair for just over 2 months. After 1 month, I could see the imprints of the springs coming through the padding of the seat. Still can't really feel the springs, so it's not an issue ""yet"". The arm padding, like I said, is thin...so now where my elbows commonly rest has completely indented the padding. Basically no padding left for my elbows. Other than that, it's still a great chair. Nothing has broken, chair is still silent and I'm still happy with it. The padding could be better, but I'll probably just get a new seat pad eventually (if I start feeling the springs)...... Still happy with the price I paid for it, but padding needs improved. for long-term usage.

"NEO CHAIR Ergonomic Office Chair PU Leather Executive Chair Padded Flip Up Armrest Computer Chair Adjustable Height High Back Lumbar Support Wheels Swivel for Gaming Desk Chair (White)",43.83,4.3,"Packaging: The chair is well packaged. All the parts were in the box. All of the hardware is labeled including a small pack containing extra pieces of hardware just inn case they are needed. The allen wrench has a T handle and is a step up from what I typically see. The seat and back come covered in plastic.Assembly: Overall the assembly is easy. The steps are in logical order starting with attaching the spider legs (my term) being attached to the center piece. At step 4 of the assembly the instructions show putting a cosmetic cover piece that hides the bolts that attach the legs to the center piece. This cover was not in the box. I reached out to the seller & they promptly responded. The assembly instructions in the box was a first addition.  There is a second addition that illuminates that step because the cover is no longer needed. They sent me an electronic version of the correct assembly instructions. I did notice during assembly that there didn‚Äôt seem to be a need for the cover because they design looks finished without the cover.Appearance: When assembled the chair looks nice. The feel of the material is nice. The finish of the back and seat were good. There were no issues with poor seams or sloppy sewing lines. It looks like they have a good level of quality control in place.Comfort: The chair feels nice with good lumbar support. I feel like it fits like a glove. However, I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô6‚Äù tall. I wouldn‚Äôt expect a taller person to have that kind of fit. The lumbar support is not adjustable. The chair will adjust in height and the recline function can be locked out.Overall I would recommend this chair as a good, no frills chair that‚Äôs comfortable. Time will tell if there are durability issues.

The feel of the material is nice. The finish of the back and seat were good. There were no issues with poor seams or sloppy sewing lines. It looks like they have a good level of quality control in place.Comfort: The chair feels nice with good lumbar support. I feel like it fits like a glove. However, I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô6‚Äù tall. I wouldn‚Äôt expect a taller person to have that kind of fit. The lumbar support is not adjustable. The chair will adjust in height and the recline function can be locked out.Overall I would recommend this chair as a good, no frills chair that‚Äôs comfortable. Time will tell if there are durability issues.

"Amazon Basics Reusable Silicone Round Baking Cups, Muffin Liners, Pack of 12, Multicolor",43.83,4.7,"I ordered these cupcake wrappers/liners for myself some time ago and loved them so I ordered another set for my DIL, who is a much better baker than I am. They are perfect for muffins or cupcakes, fit perfectly into my cupcake pan and are SO easy to clean...I pop them right on the top rack of my dishwasher! Nothing sticks to them, as far as I've experienced. The muffins or cupcakes pop right out so you can put your muffins, for example, into a napkin-lined basket without wrappers on them, even when the muffins are still warm. they are pretty colors, but I find I remove the wrappers before displaying the muffins or cupcakes. I like the thickness of them; they are hearty, not like some that are more flimsy. Good product and good value.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"ALL of the Blink stuff I have ordered is getting this same review.  After doing an insane amount of research for a home security camera system I settled on Blink for ease of set up and cost.  In both of those areas there really isn't a close second.  As far as reliability, I'll check in again in a year or two--but other reviews indicate reliability is good.  So, good news: easy set-up, great prices, video quality is as good as any, motion sensors and other software adjustable stuff is easy to understand and do.Bad news:  The system is crazy slow.  I knew that going in, so it might be a bigger deal to you.  I'm willing to live with it mostly--down the road I plan to put in a much faster, wired, real time system with only one or two cameras, and Blink has a new ""Sync Module"" that is supposed to have greater range--and maybe speed things up a bit.  The slow is annoying...but not a deal breaker.It has notified me of low batteries a few times--so now I just let it go and they seem to recover on their own.  I've also had one or two go offline and I had to reinstall them.  I think there are two factors causing this, and again for the price I am willing to live with it.  For one thing I have the wireless range maxed out even with an extender for my WiFi network.  The other factor is it is currently the dead of Winter and cold beyond all reason.  9 degrees last night, high is 31 today.  Lots of snow and wind, too.  I'm harder to get along with in this weather myself, so I'll put up with some additional problems with electronics that live outside.Bottom line?  After three months I'm happy with it and I recommend any and all of the parts of the system I've bought.  It works as advertised and it's way cheap--including the annual subscription if you want cloud storage.  I will be buying a couple more pieces soon.  It is fully functional as long as you don't need a lot of speed.  I'm talking about minutes when I‚Äôm antsy and want seconds.

"Executive Office Chair Mid Back Swivel Computer Task, Ergonomic Leather-Padded Desk Seats with Lumbar Support,Armrests, Black",43.83,4.3,"I just got the Shahoo Executive Office Chair, and I'm really happy with how well-designed and practical it is.

"Amazon Smart Plug | Works with Alexa | control lights with voice | easy to set up and use",43.83,4.7,"The only other smart plugs and switches I have currently are all Z-wave based (about 20) and I've never had issues with any of them and have them all programmed on schedules and various alerts as well as manual control.  However, obtaining Z-wave based products are getting harder and harder because it seems the market is flooded with so many off-brand plugs and switches tied to a variety of ecosystems.My preference has always been for Z-wave because those devices operate on their own wireless band outside of my 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless networks and instead communicate only to a hub that is connected to the internet.  I'm still not sold on switching out my smart devices for devices that need persistent internet access and consume wireless bandwidth but do like that this device is very easy to setup and use.I currently have this in my kids' room connected to a Vornado fan that they can call upon if they want some airflow in their room and not affect anyone else.  I've used a Z-wave switch for this in the past and have controlled it for them or set it on a schedule because I didn't want them to have access to the SmartThings app to be able to control that device and others.Setup and adoption were easy, maybe a little easier than SmartThings. Calling out to Alexa to control the device is intuitive and works well to set timers and basic on/off.However, now that the device is on my wifi network, I see that it uploads and downloads 1-5KB of data twice an hour starting at about 9 minutes after the hour and again 5 minutes later with an Amazon server with ""device-metrics""  in the hostname.  Not sure what it's doing exactly, my guess would be exchanging telemetry data or phoning home.Overall, it's a a good smart plug that's easy to use and can be trusted to some extent if you're already using Amazon devices in your home rather than tie yourself into some other ecosystem that sends data to a foreign country.

"Authentic Japanese Snack Box Subscription - Japanese Candy Mystery Box, Monthly Candy Box Containing Various Japanese Snacks: Classic Box",43.83,4.5,"Ok, so I got the first box here half price with the rare Black Friday sale.  I figured I‚Äôd get one box then cancel before the full price subscription starts (make sure you do this as soon as it ships if you plan that).  Well, I did that, then got the box... finished it in 3 days and haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it since!  Like any uncustomizable service, you might find some percentage of the set not to your tastes.  However, if you are a true connoisseur of Japanese snacks,  I think you will be impressed by the quality and variety of the offerings.  No, this is not cheap, although I did think it was definitely worth it for the sale price... full price, it is rather extravagant.  On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think you would find some of these unusual snacks anywhere else‚Ä¶ Not at most nearby asian grocery stores (I live near 5, including large supermarket types with many Japanese snacks).  A few of these can certainly be classed ‚Äúartisan‚Äù and not that mass-produced.  For example, the white chocolate infused strawberry.  I still cannot figure out how they made that.  It‚Äôs like the strawberry was actually injected with chocolate as it was freeze-dried, perfectly melded together.  That big spicy cracker thing and the pear cream biscuit were amazing, too.  Many of the other savory snacks also had a lot of complexity and depth to their flavors.  They deftly combine subtle sweet, sour, spicy, salty, and umami notes together.  They put American snacks to shame because these seem to be very one-note in comparison‚Äîjust sickly sweet or too salty.  I think it‚Äôs cool how Bokksu includes a booklet so you can learn more about the snacks and Japanese culture, too (every box has a theme).  To be sure, these are ‚Äòhigh end‚Äô fancy snacks not for bargain shoppers or those with unadventurous and unelevated palates.  Look, I have easy access to Asian supermarkets within 5 minutes from me and I‚Äôm Chinese American‚ÄîI‚Äôm well familiar with shrimp crackers, dried seaweed rice crackers, Pocky, mochi, etc; in contrast, these boxes are not run-of-the mill and is not for everyone.  You have to be willing to try different flavors and clearly, some of the reviewers who didn‚Äôt like it weren‚Äôt.  Anyway, after I finished the box, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.  After trying to ignore the cravings for a week, I ended up going on the website and purchasing a 6 month subscription for $230.  I never would have thought I‚Äôd pay that much for monthly snack boxes before,  but it is officially an addiction now! I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a luxury that I‚Äôm not going to be able to afford eventually‚Ä¶ however,  I‚Äôm going to just try it out for a few months.  I don‚Äôt know if I can say $40 a box is ‚Äúworthwhile‚Äù to most people, but for me, I must feed the obsession!

"Certified Refurbished Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa",43.83,4.4,"I purchased the Echo Studio to improved the sound quality in our dining room, which it effectively accomplished.  First, I tested out some streaming music.  Compared to other Alexa devices I've possessed, it has significantly more bass and clarity.Next,  I connected it via Bluetooth to our dining room turntable. In this set up, it felt inferior to having a complete setup, but this may be due to the fact that there is only one speaker, and the high expectations of listening to vinyl. I have not had the chance to listen to it with two Studios as left and right, and  Echo subwoofer, though I'm very curious to know what that would sound like.Nevertheless, this is an excellent speaker for streaming, as it is powerful, bassy, and distortion-free when turned all the way up. It is more than adequate for the room, which is typically used for cooking and cleaning, as well as dinner parties and game nights. With the exception of the hi-fi stereo in the family room, this is the best-sounding speaker in the home.In addition to connecting a Bluetooth turntable to it, I grouped it with my kitchen Echo Input, which connects to my ceiling speakers. The Echo Studio is a stark reminder of how inadequate and depressing my ceiling speakers are. The Studio is by far superior. However, they work together perfectly, allowing the Amazon music to broadcast seamlessly between the kitchen and dining room.  This is really the selling point, isn't it?  We have plenty of choices to stream music, but perhaps integration is what makes it different from the others.Audiophiles will likely continue to prefer a more conventional setup. I did not attempt to connect the turntable directly to the speaker (I believe it has a 1/8 auxiliary input), so audiophiles would already be cringing at the¬†Bluetooth. I'm pleased with the Studio; its sound is superior to all of the other speakers in the house besides the conventional stereo.  And while I may not have been impressed at the quality listening to records (which I had high expecations), I'm usually too lazy to put on a record or CD, so having a great-sounding speaker to stream on is definitely worthwhile.¬†  If I want to hear the record in all its glory, I can simply walk into the family room and listen to the other turntable with the hi-fi receiver, amplifier, and speaker pairs.  For daily streaming, which is 90% of what we listen to, this is a great purchase and the integration and speaker groups feature that Amazon has makes it worthwhile.

"Certified Refurbished Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) | HD smart display with motion and Alexa | Charcoal",43.83,4.4,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
¬†I am no stranger to the Echo Show devices as I have a few:- Here‚Äôs what I love about the Show 10:-Pros:-1. A standout feature is the motorized screen that effortlessly follows your movements. During video calls with my family, especially when attending to my sweet baby girl with special needs, the auto-tracking ensures that whether I'm at her drawer finding clean clothes, at the diaper caddy, or administering medication, I remain within the central view.2. The 10.1-inch screen is perfect for watching videos, engaging in video calls, or simply reading content from your display.3. The speakers are definitely speaking! delivering exceptionally crisp and loud audio.4. Additionally, it includes a built-in hub for smart home controls ‚Äì So I can group, monitor, and control my smart home devices5. The option to add widgets is a plus. My personal favorite is the sticky notes feature, allowing me to include heartfelt love and appreciation notes to my husband, children, and nurse.6. The calendar widgets are a favorite among my baby's home care nurses. They enable them to easily view all her upcoming appointments and reminders at a glance.To Consider (before purchase):-If space is a concern, it's worth noting that it cannot be placed directly against the wall, unlike other Echo Shows, unless you disable the auto-tracking feature. The speaker, around which the screen rotates, measures approximately 5 inches in height and 4.5 inches in width. It requires about 4.5 inches of clearance on all sides to allow the screen to rotate freely with auto-tracking and to prevent collisions with walls or other obstacles. Personally, this doesn't pose an issue for me as I appreciate the auto-tracking feature, so I have given the echo the necessary space to spin to its heart‚Äôs content.Drawbacks:-1. When viewing security footage, there is a lag of up to 10 seconds, meaning that what appears on the screen has already transpired. This is likely due to the inability to directly download camera or other apps onto the Echo Show.2. The inability to install your desired apps on the device for a more customized experience.Final Opinion:-Despite the drawbacks, I'd recommend it as the positives far outweigh the negatives.

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"I'm not the most tech savvy, so haven't set up a ton of the features an Echo could have and don't use it for much, but it's still becoming a very helpful assistant around the house. It understands voice very well, and has a clear shut off for both the camera and microphone separately, so you know when those are shut off for privacy concerns. When you ask, it will tell you what Amazon products are being delivered today, which is very helpful if you buy a lot online. You can thank your driver with it, check your order status, and ask many different questions. Vs the google hub, I get more useful answers out of the Echo when asking specific questions, like asking when 10 days later will be, etc. Whether you have an Amazon music account or not, you can get it to play stations you like, which I've ended up using a lot as it's more convenient than turning on the Bluetooth speakers, and sound quality is good. For listening to music, the Echo is more than good enough in both volume and quality. You can also do video calls, which is a very helpful feature, both if you have multiple Echos around the house, or if you have someone on a phone with the Alexa app. And of course you can set little reminders or timers, which have become a habit very quickly due to the convenience. I have mine set up between the living room and kitchen, where we can use it in both rooms, and it's a great time and hand saver. It was extremely easy to set up, and just works, without fuss or manual updates. Great home assistant, and I know it has a lot more features to explore if I can find the time to.

"Disney Pin - Winnie the Pooh with Mickey Balloon",43.83,4.4,"This pin arrived well packaged, with a kind little card describing the attention to detail that went into shipping it. It's perfect in every way, and doesn't feel like it's ever been used in the past. Sometimes the backs can get loose with too much use, and that hasn't happened here. The angle of Pooh dangling is perfect for a shirt, and has a sense of adventure and fun when you see it. One side note, the balloon is made out if some kind of super soft, kinda squishy material that makes me smile whenever I touch it. I'm not sure what that is, but I love it. Because the material is different it isn't as reflective as the rest, which sets the contrast beautifully. I couldn't be happier. It might be my nicest pin, ever!

"Authentic Japanese Snack Box Subscription - Japanese Candy Mystery Box, Monthly Candy Box Containing Various Japanese Snacks: Classic Box",43.83,4.5,"Ok, so I got the first box here half price with the rare Black Friday sale.  I figured I‚Äôd get one box then cancel before the full price subscription starts (make sure you do this as soon as it ships if you plan that).  Well, I did that, then got the box... finished it in 3 days and haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it since!  Like any uncustomizable service, you might find some percentage of the set not to your tastes.  However, if you are a true connoisseur of Japanese snacks,  I think you will be impressed by the quality and variety of the offerings.  No, this is not cheap, although I did think it was definitely worth it for the sale price... full price, it is rather extravagant.  On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think you would find some of these unusual snacks anywhere else‚Ä¶ Not at most nearby asian grocery stores (I live near 5, including large supermarket types with many Japanese snacks).  A few of these can certainly be classed ‚Äúartisan‚Äù and not that mass-produced.  For example, the white chocolate infused strawberry.  I still cannot figure out how they made that.  It‚Äôs like the strawberry was actually injected with chocolate as it was freeze-dried, perfectly melded together.  That big spicy cracker thing and the pear cream biscuit were amazing, too.  Many of the other savory snacks also had a lot of complexity and depth to their flavors.  They deftly combine subtle sweet, sour, spicy, salty, and umami notes together.  They put American snacks to shame because these seem to be very one-note in comparison‚Äîjust sickly sweet or too salty.  I think it‚Äôs cool how Bokksu includes a booklet so you can learn more about the snacks and Japanese culture, too (every box has a theme).  To be sure, these are ‚Äòhigh end‚Äô fancy snacks not for bargain shoppers or those with unadventurous and unelevated palates.  Look, I have easy access to Asian supermarkets within 5 minutes from me and I‚Äôm Chinese American‚ÄîI‚Äôm well familiar with shrimp crackers, dried seaweed rice crackers, Pocky, mochi, etc; in contrast, these boxes are not run-of-the mill and is not for everyone.  You have to be willing to try different flavors and clearly, some of the reviewers who didn‚Äôt like it weren‚Äôt.  Anyway, after I finished the box, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.  After trying to ignore the cravings for a week, I ended up going on the website and purchasing a 6 month subscription for $230.  I never would have thought I‚Äôd pay that much for monthly snack boxes before,  but it is officially an addiction now! I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a luxury that I‚Äôm not going to be able to afford eventually‚Ä¶ however,  I‚Äôm going to just try it out for a few months.  I don‚Äôt know if I can say $40 a box is ‚Äúworthwhile‚Äù to most people, but for me, I must feed the obsession!

"Certified Refurbished Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa",43.83,4.4,"I purchased the Echo Studio to improved the sound quality in our dining room, which it effectively accomplished.  First, I tested out some streaming music.  Compared to other Alexa devices I've possessed, it has significantly more bass and clarity.Next,  I connected it via Bluetooth to our dining room turntable. In this set up, it felt inferior to having a complete setup, but this may be due to the fact that there is only one speaker, and the high expectations of listening to vinyl. I have not had the chance to listen to it with two Studios as left and right, and  Echo subwoofer, though I'm very curious to know what that would sound like.Nevertheless, this is an excellent speaker for streaming, as it is powerful, bassy, and distortion-free when turned all the way up. It is more than adequate for the room, which is typically used for cooking and cleaning, as well as dinner parties and game nights. With the exception of the hi-fi stereo in the family room, this is the best-sounding speaker in the home.In addition to connecting a Bluetooth turntable to it, I grouped it with my kitchen Echo Input, which connects to my ceiling speakers. The Echo Studio is a stark reminder of how inadequate and depressing my ceiling speakers are. The Studio is by far superior. However, they work together perfectly, allowing the Amazon music to broadcast seamlessly between the kitchen and dining room.  This is really the selling point, isn't it?  We have plenty of choices to stream music, but perhaps integration is what makes it different from the others.Audiophiles will likely continue to prefer a more conventional setup. I did not attempt to connect the turntable directly to the speaker (I believe it has a 1/8 auxiliary input), so audiophiles would already be cringing at the¬†Bluetooth. I'm pleased with the Studio; its sound is superior to all of the other speakers in the house besides the conventional stereo.  And while I may not have been impressed at the quality listening to records (which I had high expecations), I'm usually too lazy to put on a record or CD, so having a great-sounding speaker to stream on is definitely worthwhile.¬†  If I want to hear the record in all its glory, I can simply walk into the family room and listen to the other turntable with the hi-fi receiver, amplifier, and speaker pairs.  For daily streaming, which is 90% of what we listen to, this is a great purchase and the integration and speaker groups feature that Amazon has makes it worthwhile.

"Certified Refurbished Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa | Twilight Blue",43.83,4.6,"We've been using a first-generation Amazon Echo (the tower type) since it first came out ages ago. Recently, though, it began acting a bit wonky and it was more than a challenge to get it set up again properly, as the software apparently changed a lot across time. Time for a new device.We got the refurbished 4th generation version of the Echo for half of what the new one cost. Like with other Amazon refurbished items, it was indistinguishable from a brand-new version and works just as well. We use it as an alarm, a white noise machine, an answer-machine, and an internet radio (especially for WMVY and WUMB). It works great, much better than the first-gen model ever did. It understands verbal commands much more easily, sounds considerably better, and looks a lot better, too. We like its round form better than the older tower model.Consider this a ringing endorsement of both the current Echo and Amazon's refurbished products program!

"Amazon Reload",43.83,4.7,"This is a good way to always have an Amazon Gift Card Balance ready for anything you may need or want at Amazon. You determine the amount you want to apply to the account and it will be ready for you within a short period.  If you like, you may want to add a certain amount each month, day, or week. When you set it to auto-reload your balance on a schedule, be careful how you set it up. Example: Don't set it up on a day of the month and move the box to the next day or you will automatically add the amount you want to add in the current month and not the next month when you want it to start. I did this and was surprised to find out what happened. So, load up your account with your pre-determined amount each period of time to keep your Amazon Gift Card Balance ready for anything.

This is NOT a full-blown Android tablet, but it is a very useful device if your needs correspond to the available apps.  It's great for watching videos and movies, very good for web browsing, and a fine (but heavy) Kindle for reading books.Side-loading the Google Play store and its apps is a hit-and-miss thing, but I have been able to get several apps from the Google Play store installed and running (including YouTube).  Notable exceptions are the Gmail and Google Calendar apps, which I have been unable to make work reliably on this or my other late-model Fire.

"The Women: A Novel",43.83,4.8,"üí≠ Breathtaking, devastating and evocative, The Women was masterfully crafted and bursting at the seams with emotion. It's a novel that shifted my understanding and perspective and one that I will, without a doubt, never forget.üìö The Women‚úç Kristin Hannahüìñ Historical Fiction‚≠ê5/5‚û°In 1965, idyllic Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath believes she can put her skills to good use and make the world a better place. Born into a family that idolizes war heroes, including her brother, she sees herself as a trailblazer when she enlists to serve in Vietnam as a nurse. Like so many of the troops she treats, Frankie is unprepared and overwhelmed by the mayhem and devastation of war, and startled by the new reality that she returns to.Frankie's story is told in the before, during and after of one woman's harrowing experience in Vietnam. Through the love, loss and loneliness that can only be associated with war, Hannah tells the unforgettable story of one woman but the tale of countless women whose dedication, service and sacrifice deserve the gratitude of a nation.‚óæüôè Immense gratitude to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the advanced reader copy of The Women. All opinions are my own.üéØ What I loved: Wow. This book honestly blew me away. It typically takes me a while to get into historical fiction novels, and a bit more time to read but I could not put this down and devoured it in two days. Hannah's tremendous aptitude for humanizing tragedy on a personal level is unlike any writer I've ever experienced. Though going into a Kristin Hannah book I know I'm likely to have my heart broken, I feel like I always come out the other side with a different perspective and wisdom than I had going in. Without giving away any spoilers, I'll just say that this book was incredible. It moved me to tears, had me believing in the resiliency of the human spirit and broke me apart over and over.üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What I didn't: This book was incredible but be prepared to cry.‚óæRead if you love:*emotional reads*historical fiction focused on the 1960s and 1970s*war fiction‚óæSee also: The Nightingale, Home Front, The Alice Network

"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)",43.83,4.8,"A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015 - possibly even my number one. I have been (not-so-patiently) waiting on A Court of Mist and Fury literally since book one ended and obviously preordered a copy as soon as I could! Upon receiving it in the mail, I quickly started reading but didn't want to read it too quickly. This is one of those books you also want to savor! Especially knowing that I'll have to wait an entire year for the final book in the series. Before I jump into this review, let me say that I do not think Sarah J. Maas can do no wrong. I read the first two books in her Throne of Glass series before giving up on that one. But THIS series... In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection.This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyre's character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about (as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them).As I'm sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a ""team"" and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly #TeamRhysand at this point and I don't see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering that's what most YA fiction gravitates towards.I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be (although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat) and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses.One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury (and honestly, there are so many) was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas' beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. I'll admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page.And then there's the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As I've already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with - mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600+ pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didn't. There wasn't non-stop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldn't name anything that served only as filler.Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but I'm totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, it's not out of the question that they're probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think it's important to point out for those readers who perhaps don't want to read steamier scenes. (I'm sure you could easily skip past them.)As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling. I honestly cannot go on without becoming a total fangirl so instead I'll leave you with what I have dubbed Rhysand's theme song (you're welcome): [...]

"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 4)",43.83,4.3,"A Court of Frost and Starlight was exactly what it was advertised as: a fun, short, and festive novella about the Inner Circle celebrating the Winter Solstice and Feyre‚Äôs birthday. Besides the festivities, we get to see the characters rebuilding Prythian and supporting each other in the aftermath of the war. This book is everything that I was expecting and more. I specifically saved it to read during the winter, instead of when it published, like everyone else. I‚Äôm glad I made that decision because I can imagine Velaris during the holidays so vividly while experiencing the cold weather myself. ACOFAS is a lovely, sweet, and lighthearted story with holiday cheer. However, it still has a dark, melancholy feel to it because of the scars that the war left in its wake. It warms my heart to read about the Court of Dreams feeling happy, festive, relaxed, and peaceful. After the distress and heartache in ACOWAR, they deserved to have a happy holiday. Especially since every character is still dealing with the impact. It‚Äôs awesome to have new content about my favorite characters, even if it‚Äôs just a novella. I would‚Äôve been disappointed if Feyre‚Äôs narrative finished with ACOWAR. It was a good ending but it was too open for me to be completely satisfied with it. I love ACOFAS so much and I‚Äôm so happy that Sarah J. Maas wrote this book!!‚Äî‚Äî-Below, I mention what I love and dislike about ACOFAS, with specific spoilers and concluding thoughts. If you haven‚Äôt read ACOFAS and don‚Äôt want to be spoiled, do NOT read past this. If you want to be spoiled so you can decide to read this book, then be my guest. If you have read ACOFAS and are interested in hearing my opinions, then go ahead. Overall, thank you for reading my review!!______What I loved about ACOFAS:- The Inner Circle doing normal, fun things like shopping!! This isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs seen often in a Fantasy world.- Multiple points of view!!! I enjoy reading books like this. Especially when there‚Äôs a large number of characters that I love. I want to know everyone‚Äôs thinking!! I think books written this way are more open minded, instead of viewing everything from one perspective.- CHAPTER 13. Feyre goes shopping with Elain in a weaver‚Äôs shop and asks about a tapestry. The weavers response about her grief and needing to create is powerful. This scene was so emotionally moving for me. I reacted the same way as Feyre while reading the chapter!!- Feyre beginning to paint again!! Also, her feeling weaver‚Äôs words in her heart and soul. I always love when characters have artistic hobbies. It was really motivating to see Feyre remember the Suriel and using those last words to make a change in Velaris. Feyre and Ressina (side character) starting free art therapy classes for children and parents was so inspiring!! I really enjoyed Feyre‚Äôs character in this book. The theme of using art to express emotions/trauma and to heal is the best part of this story!!- NESTA. I loved her character in ACOWAR and she was fabulous in that book. Although it was short, I‚Äôm glad that we got to read in her view. Nesta admitting that she feels nothing is sad, depressing, and concerning. I still love her character though. I like that Nesta has found somewhat of a friend in Amren. I strongly believe that Nesta deserves a happy ending! Yes, I‚Äôm extremely excited about the Nesta and Cassian spin-off book!!!- AMREN. She‚Äôs hilarious and such an entertaining character. Her reactions to the gifts she received is amazing. I love what Amren said about Nesta. I share the same thoughts about her. We got to see more of Amren & Varian, which I enjoyed.- ELAIN. She‚Äôs has a cute, kind, and gentle personality. It was nice to see her recovery from ACOWAR and busying herself with helping Nuala & Cerridwen. I can personally relate to Elain a lot in this book.- Feyre and Rhysand are relationship goals!! It‚Äôs so endearing the way that these cuties love and support each other through everything. I think everyone deserves a relationship like Rhys & Feyre!- The snowball fight Solstice tradition that Rhysand, Cassian, and Azriel do at the cabin. This Illyrian bat trio is so adorable!!- Rhysand, Feyre, Amren, Mor, Cassian, Azriel, Elain, even Nesta and Varian spending time together!! The Court of Dreams laughter and giving gifts. I live for the banter between them!! They are my favorite fictional group characters and ACOFAS made me love the Inner Circle even more.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-What I didn‚Äôt like about ACOFAS:- The wall scene. I wasn‚Äôt excited about it and I don‚Äôt care about this scene at all. I didn‚Äôt mind these scenes in the other books because they full length. It bothered me in ACOFAS because the book is shorter than the others. I‚Äôm over Maas sex scenes now though. Honestly, I would‚Äôve preferred Azriel or Elain to get a chapter in their point of view than a full chapter about Feyre & Rhys making love (in such a short book).- Rhys going to the Spring Court and saying those negative things to Tamlin. I understand that Tamlin can‚Äôt be forgiven for his actions, but Rhysand‚Äôs words were unnecessary. As Lucien said: ‚ÄúYour mate should‚Äôve known better than to kick a downed male‚Äù (page 165). However, I was relieved to see that Rhysand was self aware and knew he behaved poorly.- Elain and Azriel being the only two without a chapters in their points of view. I love their characters and I personally relate to them for different reasons. I really hope Sarah writes a spin-off book or novella to make up for this!!These dislikes are why I gave ACOFAS four stars instead of five.‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîACOFAS didn‚Äôt really have much of a plot which I was completely fine with!! I was anticipating this because it‚Äôs just a novella to update us on the characters before the spin-off novels. For this reason, I can somewhat understand why the general consensus about ACOFAS is that it‚Äôs disappointing. Especially since most people in the book reading world read Fantasy books. ACOFAS is much more character oriented and not plot friendly. As I said above, I think this is something that‚Äôs not usually seen in a book set in a Fantasy world. I primarily read YA Contemporary books, so I‚Äôm accustomed to reading character oriented stories. ACOFAS didn‚Äôt disappoint me at all! What disappoints me is the mixed and negative comments about it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting so many low reviews for a Sarah J. Maas book because most of them well received. As usual, I have an unpopular opinion about a Sarah J. Maas book or character(s)!! In conclusion, I throughly enjoyed reading A Court of Frost of Starlight. I think it‚Äôs a wonderful, amazing, and positive story that‚Äôs worth reading, especially if you‚Äôre like me: a die hard ACOTAR fan. This book is now one of my favorites!!

"House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, 1)",43.83,4.7,"Writing this book after reading it for the third time and I truly can't rave about it enough.This book is so. much. fun. Such an indulgent read. It has such rich world-building and deeply human and complex characters.Growing up, urban fantasy was the only way I read fantasy books, so jumping into that kind of world again was so much fun. It is the perfect setting for a crime/murder mystery plot, which felt so original and refreshing compared to most fantasy books.The romance in this book is the most indulgent, comforting, reluctant-friends-to-lovers romance story I've ever read. Bryce and Hunt's relationship feels so authentic. I blush and get butterflies right alongside the characters.Every character is so unique and they all have so much depth. Reading about how they all grow and interact with each other is such a treat.Reading it after finishing House of Sky and Breath, it's incredible to see how much intention and planning went into this. I could talk about this book for hours.

"A Court of Mist and Fury (The Court of Thorns and Roses Series, Book 2)",43.83,4.8,"A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015 - possibly even my number one. I have been (not-so-patiently) waiting on A Court of Mist and Fury literally since book one ended and obviously preordered a copy as soon as I could! Upon receiving it in the mail, I quickly started reading but didn't want to read it too quickly. This is one of those books you also want to savor! Especially knowing that I'll have to wait an entire year for the final book in the series. Before I jump into this review, let me say that I do not think Sarah J. Maas can do no wrong. I read the first two books in her Throne of Glass series before giving up on that one. But THIS series... In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection.This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyre's character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about (as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them).As I'm sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a ""team"" and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly #TeamRhysand at this point and I don't see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering that's what most YA fiction gravitates towards.I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be (although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat) and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses.One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury (and honestly, there are so many) was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas' beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. I'll admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page.And then there's the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As I've already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with - mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600+ pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didn't. There wasn't non-stop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldn't name anything that served only as filler.Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but I'm totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, it's not out of the question that they're probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think it's important to point out for those readers who perhaps don't want to read steamier scenes. (I'm sure you could easily skip past them.)As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling. I honestly cannot go on without becoming a total fangirl so instead I'll leave you with what I have dubbed Rhysand's theme song (you're welcome): [...]

"The Teacher",43.83,4.3,"...because I absolutely MUST keep reading!I've read nearly all of Freida's books and this is definitely one of the best. As usual, very cleverly done, well-written, engaging, and always with twists that make you wonder what happens after the book is over.The Teacher had several major shockers. I guessed 2 of them as possibilities, only because I knew there had to be some twists coming. But 2 others were totally unexpected!I normally only have time to read in the evenings, but I took time out today - when I was supposed to be working (from home) - because I just couldn't wait til tonight to finish it.That's something I never ever do. This book is THAT good!The only minor critique would be that, about halfway through when the story shifted, it accelerated rather quickly. It felt like it sort of jumped from a basic relationship to something more a little too quickly, and I'd have liked to have had a bit more insight into how that character felt about that development. But that's very minor.Freida did a fantastic job of telling the story from a teenager's point of view. She really nailed the language, thought processes, and temperament of a 16-yo-girl. The alternating points of view had different personalities and it was easy to tell which was which. This takes really good writing skills. So many authors just switch back and forth but all the characters sound the same; Not so here - the characters' voices were distinctive.Keep 'em coming, Freida!

"The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles",43.83,4.5,"The cover of The War of Art has a quote by Esquire Magazine. It reads, ‚ÄúA vital gem‚Ä¶ a kick in the ass.‚Äù Flip the book open and the reader will see the book is published by a firm called Black Irish Entertainment. It‚Äôs logo is a single boxing glove. While reading this book, I couldn‚Äôt help but constantly think back to this quote and image. Each chapter felt like a punch to the gut, a wake up call, a kick in the ass. Steven Pressfield titled his book The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles and he presents his readers with just that. A manual on fighting and defeating the opponent of life and resistance. I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for the tools necessary to overcome life‚Äôs greatest obstacles, develop yourself into an accomplished professional, and become the ultimate versions of yourself. Here's why:The book was first published in 2002 and written by Steven Pressfield. Pressfield is most known for his historical fiction but has also produced many award winning non-fiction works and screenplays. His first book, The Legend of Bagger Vance, was made into a reputable film in 1995. His writing often draws parallels between historical classics, religious archetypes, and motivational revelations about his struggles and others‚Äô. His tales have motivated multitudes of individuals to conquer their fears, reach their potential, and accomplish their dreams.The War of Art is split into three books. The first book is called Resistance: Defining the Enemy. He uses this chapter to call out what he believes as the root to most of our problems. He defines Resistance as ‚ÄúThe enemy within‚Äù and a ‚ÄúForce of nature‚Äù. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúrepelling force. It‚Äôs negative‚Äù, ‚ÄúResistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work‚Äù, and ‚ÄúResistance aims to kill.‚Äù He says everyone has had a battle with Resistance and it‚Äôs the root to many of the issues we face and develop in our lives. Substance dependence, unhappiness, and anger are just some of the effects caused from our internal battle with this self-sabotage energy. Each chapter is poetically written to describe the way resistance can infiltrate our lives and destroy us from within. The goal of this chapter is to identify to readers Resistance‚Äôs characteristics so they can recognize and fight it when face to face with this malevolence.The second book is called Combating Resistance: Turning Pro. Pressfield uses the terms professional and amateur to describe the battle with Resistance. He explains that those defeated by Resistance think like amateurs, and professionals are equipped with the tools to overpower their Resistance and reach their potential. Some of these chapters describe a professional's attributes. They‚Äôre titled: A Professional is Patient, A Professional Acts in the Face of Fear, A Professional Reinvents Himself, etc. He uses stories and accounts of his own life and others, such as golfer Tiger Woods, to paint the picture of perseverance, focus, and strength. My favorite quote from this book comes from his chapter How to be Miserable. A marine himself, he briefly talks about how Marines are trained to love being miserable, to embrace the struggle, and fight to the death. The last line reads: ‚ÄúBecause this is war, baby. And War is hell.‚ÄùBook Three is called Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm. This chapter aims to harness the psychic powers needed to fight the Resistance he described earlier. He uses terms such as angels, demons, and muses, but offers his more secular audience the option to think of these forces as abstract and impersonal, such as gravity, instincts, or universal forces. He claims we need these allies if we are ever to defeat the enemy of Resistance. He mentions the Athenian Xenophon who would make sacrifices to the gods and call for their aid before any expedition. His own version of this he calls invoking the Muse, a Greek mythology term used to describe the nine Goddesses, or even a person or personified force used as a source of inspiration to artists. Additionally, Pressfield goes on to describe the difference between the Ego and Self. With quotes from famous psychologists such as Freud and Jung, he believes the Ego is where Resistance lies, while the Self is where the angles, or good forces, live. He describes the characteristics of the ego and how it is the ‚Äúpart of the psyche that believes in material existence‚Äù and nothing more. While the Self is our deepest being, united to God, and is ever-growing and ever-evolving. The Ego hates the Self, Pressfield writes, and is the perpetrator for growth, progression, and success. He goes on to describe what the Authentic self looks like, how to defeat the hierarchical orientation, and how to unleash the artist within us.As a young aspiring professional on the cusp of a career and ‚Äúthe rest of my life‚Äù, this book struck the deepest cord in me and immediately earned its place in my list of books to re-read every year. It‚Äôs an easy read and I read it cover to cover in about three hours. It‚Äôs organized like a manual, with short chapters, and important titles and messages that will resonate with you at different points in your life. While reading its entirety is do-able, one can just as easily flip through the chapters and meditate on the headline and chapter that speaks to you most. It makes for the ultimate bed-side book for any artists looking for daily motivation to break through their creative struggles. Pressfield also seemed to speak to me specifically. I have long been a lover of Greek mythology and culture, Xenophon, and the Bhagavad-Gita, all which he mentions and parallels in his chapters. I was also a fan of the spiritual take-aways in his third book. The War of Art is a self-help book, but differs to many I have read. It is straight to the point, raw, and hard-hitting. While many self-help books rely on abstract and vague themes, Pressfield tells his readers his truth with his own words, as blunt as possible. It‚Äôs entertaining, easy to read, and powerful to anyone seeking help.Typically, I try to stay away from definitive statements, such as ‚ÄúEveryone would enjoy or resonate with this book.‚Äù We are all individuals that react differently to everything. But I do firmly believe this book would provide everyone of it‚Äôs readers a piece of something they have been looking for. We are all artists, and without unlocking the creative power within us, we find ourselves riddled with dilemmas and obstacles that are far from conquerable. For all willing, this book will help you identify the enemy, equip you with the tools to fight, and unlock the mystical powers that will help you live a fulfilling life.

"Mother Night: Myths, Stories and Teachings for Learning to See in the Dark",43.83,4.5,"My mother passed on Women Who Run With the Wolves to me when I was in the dark stages of my teens, (about 15 years old).  My three sisters have also read these tales that might as well be true, considering how effective they are to real life. Together we read these magical stories that seemed to clear away the build-up of past hurts and painful experiences.Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes has this gift of healing through her poetic words and she is a universal mother that gives strength to all women who run, (and the men that run with us).I have purchased Mother Night on pure faith, knowing that this is the next step to being closer to that ineffable wild spirit that nurtures, heals, and protects, the wild spirit that Dr. Pinkola Estes channels. Somehow her deep-rooted, ancient wisdom reconnects the body/mind/soul.My love and gratitude to her and her work can only be described as a pure, wild heart.

"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 3)",43.83,4.8,"Court of Wings and Ruin, the third installment in the Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J. Maas, is an absolute triumph that will leave readers breathless and yearning for more. This epic fantasy novel takes us on a thrilling journey filled with political intrigue, heart-stopping action, and a love that transcends boundaries.In this mesmerizing tale, Feyre returns to the Spring Court with a burning determination to uncover the truth about Tamlin‚Äôs actions and the invading king who threatens to bring her world to its knees. As she delves deeper into a dangerous game of deceit, the stakes are higher than ever before. One wrong move could spell doom not only for Feyre but for everything and everyone she holds dear.Maas skillfully weaves a complex web of alliances, betrayals, and unexpected alliances that keep readers on the edge of their seats. The world-building is impeccable, immersing us in a realm of magic, power, and deadly secrets.

"Circe",43.83,4.6,"Even if you have never been acquainted with the classics, or the  Greek and Roman gods;  even if you don‚Äôt know that Prometheus was made to suffer so we mortals could have fire, this book will charm you and obsess you and  keep you reading way past the time you should have left for work.Here is Circe: sea nymph with witchcraft. She longs for a lover. And she poisons her competition. She clings to her brother, a mortal with the power of Gods. We feel her loneliness and her desire. She wants a lover.The author is a professor of classics. She decided to tell the story of the siege of Troy, the Trojan horse, the hero Achilles, and his powerful goddess mother.The author reimagines the gods and the warriors and the kings as being just like us: they lust, they envy, and they suffer.  Kings and Gods we feel should know better, go to war for the wrong reasons; they steal, and they lie. Yet their life loves, their heart pains, their infidelities, attachments and longings, tear our hearts too.  We root for them as we turn the page. We long for our heroes to prevail.  Our hearts bleed for Achilles‚Äôs mother. This is after all her son.  Achilles slaughters and kills. He has no reservations about what is needed to win a battle.  He glories in the deaths of his foes. But he like his mother also longs for love and fears the power of the gods.The author does not just tell us a story we will want to hear, she embellishes it with texture- nudity, shame, beauty, the touch of intimacy, the gore of killing, the size of the fleet, the weariness of slaughter and the colors of blood. Here is a story for all time told with deliberate pace. The climax will leave you shattered, surprised, and satisfied.I am hoping the author is already onto her third book. Her last two, of  which this is one, still resonate in my imagination.  You will never think of Circe, the legend of Achilles or the Trojan war in the same way.This is a book of wonder, magic, power, and love.  I highly recommend it.

"House of Earth and Blood: Crescent City, Book 1",43.83,4.7,"Writing this book after reading it for the third time and I truly can't rave about it enough.This book is so. much. fun. Such an indulgent read. It has such rich world-building and deeply human and complex characters.Growing up, urban fantasy was the only way I read fantasy books, so jumping into that kind of world again was so much fun. It is the perfect setting for a crime/murder mystery plot, which felt so original and refreshing compared to most fantasy books.The romance in this book is the most indulgent, comforting, reluctant-friends-to-lovers romance story I've ever read. Bryce and Hunt's relationship feels so authentic. I blush and get butterflies right alongside the characters.Every character is so unique and they all have so much depth. Reading about how they all grow and interact with each other is such a treat.Reading it after finishing House of Sky and Breath, it's incredible to see how much intention and planning went into this. I could talk about this book for hours.

"Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents",43.83,4.8,"This book was assigned as part of one of my Social Work classes and I cannot tell you how impactful this book was to me. It was a very emotional experience and gave me a true awareness of the tragic history of BIPOC in America. I'd always known numerous ways in which the government (and the various systems in place in society) had behaved toward BIPOC (Civil Rights Movement, Trail of Tears, among others), but the stories included in this incredible read provided even further context and heartbreaking details to give the complete picture of these travesties.

"The Four Winds: A Novel",43.83,4.6,"I think Kristen Hanna is a good author, in general, but I think that this book was too  long, too drawn out, the suffering seemed to never end.. but of course, it wrapped up very nicely at the very end.I felt like I would never get to the end of it.It was very descriptive and no doubt very authentically historical. But I couldn‚Äôt wait to finish it and I only did because I needed to, Just because I had invested so much time in it. I did not expect it to get better, and it did not .It‚Äôs much like the classic grapes of wrath, but not nearly as well written.overall, I was disappointed. I feel like she had felt that she needed to write another book-  and this is what it was.

"A Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 5)",43.83,4.8,"Let‚Äôs get a few things straight before we do this. As much I was chomping on the bit to see what SJM does with Nesta‚Äôs multi faceted character, few things to remember.1. Nesta did a lot of crappy stuff, mainly in her early life pre Prythian, especially how she treated Feyre. And she continued a lot of that behavior later as well. Even with Cassian, who knew it was all for show but got hurt anyway. And I know post war, most of it is coming from her trauma.2. While I don‚Äôt begrudge her her trauma and her own process of healing, I also refuse to begrudge how the others feel towards her by this point; Elain and Feyre‚Äôs desperation in dealing with her, and Rhys‚Äôs resentment of, first how she treated his mate, and then how she behaved overall as part of his court, may all grate, but are all perfectly valid reactions. Because let‚Äôs face it, anti heroine or not, anyone would do the same, especially a territorial Fae male. As for Rhys being obnoxious to her, well they‚Äôre both alpha-h-o-l-e-s doing what alpha-h-o-l-e-s do, flawed and human (well, not human) and arrogant and that‚Äôs why we love them. Does it make them good or bad? No, just makes them family.3. I was firmly in the camp of Nesta being a superbly nuanced character who deserved redemption, and a proper meaty character arc. Not a hater at all, but not blind to her faults either. Girl needed to do some serious groveling before all was said and done.What SJM did do with Nesta‚Äôs character, is nothing short of wonderfully, breathtakingly GLORIOUS. The author is a master of crafting characters, but the ACOTAR series has so far seen mainly characters that are already fully developed, if complex. Except perhaps for Feyre, the Night court had already reached their potential as characters, being old and wise and all. But Nesta was prime for some growth. So gather round dear readers, for a masterclass is about to unfold. Never before has Nesta been more relatable than this book. I said what I said. Right from her tenuous mental health to her emotional constipation and self loathing and trust issues and lashing out, down to her weakness for romance, there‚Äôs something here for everyone. She is an onion, with her beautiful, complex layers that we finally get to unravel. Oh you‚Äôll still probably want to strangle her a few times. But that‚Äôs the fun, innit. What you‚Äôre left with at the end is a flawed, real, MF-ing Queen.And what is better suited to Nesta‚Äôs steely flame than Cassian‚Äôs raging fire? They‚Äôre true opposites, yin and yang, and together they create fireworks. I‚Äôve always adored Cassian, irreverent general and devoted best friend, but in this book? I don‚Äôt have the words to do him justice. Often underestimated and unfairly maligned, he‚Äôs a Prince among males, always there for everyone, and our beloved Illyrian warrior does swoon like nobody‚Äôs business. Must protect him at all costs. Nes don‚Äôt need no man, but he‚Äôs everything she could need if she wishes. Well aware he couldn‚Äôt be the one to heal her, but prepared to be there to help with every step of the healing anyway. How she hurt him made my heart ache, but how he loved her through everything anyway made my heart weep. Not that he didn‚Äôt do some hurting too, albeit inadvertently.Let‚Äôs talk about that romance y‚Äôall, the payoff of the books‚Äô worth of simmering tension. Holy Cauldron, Mother, and all the Gods, SJM has been ~unleashed~ as an adult fantasy romance author, as she was born to do. The years of chemistry freaking exploded in this book, right off the page, the HEAT setting my body and soul on fire, with their dirty mouths and filthy activities (cue fogged up glasses). The training scenes alone are worth the price of admission. Their soul deep connection is a living, breathing thing consumes them, and you. I lived for their soft moments as much as their fire. While nothing can replace ACOMAF in my heart, I‚Äôd go so far as to say this is objectively her best work, and with the level of writing she‚Äôs produced in the past, that‚Äôs a mighty claim indeed. Inspiring, funny, emotional, sensual, epic, this book is ~everything~ I could‚Äôve wished for.As always, we get some massively cinematic moments (see: training montage), tons of action, lots of humor, of course, apart from the top tier smut. Her handling of their messy, delicate family dynamic is so real it hit me right in the feels; both found families and blood ties woven beautifully through the narrative, including an unlikeliest of heart melting friendships. Heck, I could just read about the Bromance of the Illyrian trio forever. A plot point I would have typically deemed unnecessary is also very cleverly threaded into the story so as to make perfect sense. Unsurprisingly, I‚Äôm left an ugly crying, sobbing, emotional wreck, my heart in smithereens but full of joy and hope and anticipation. I don‚Äôt know where to go from here; all I can do now is curl into a ball and pray the wait for the next book goes quick.

"A Court of Thorns and Roses eBook Bundle: A 5 Book Bundle",43.83,4.8,"If you like spicy romance novels and you like high fantasy novels, you will like this series. It is an adult series for adult themes and adult scenes, not just spice, but also gore/war/torture, and that is important to note. This series has its own magic system and mythologies, and is connected to other universes of the author including Crescent City and Throne of Glass but can be read on its own. I think it is a really good series.SPOILERS (not heavy spoilers but will talk about things which happen in the book in a general sense) for conversation about feminism/fascism/mental illness.Many people want a high fantasy series which is feminist in nature and the male love interests are feminist, this is not that kind of book. It definitely has feminist undertones and female empowerment undertones, it is written by a female author which historically high-fantasy books in a female lens have been shunned so I prefer to support female authors, but the love interest does many things which are not feminist.The male love interest in this book drugs her and dances inappropriately with her, and then claims there was no other way to make the villain think he didn‚Äôt care about the protagonist and put her in danger. That is pretty unbelievable, there are a million other options that do not include drugging someone in that situation.The male love interest ‚Äúrescues‚Äù the protagonist and brings her to a place which only his friends and family, for hundreds of years of relational ties, are. This technically is a social isolation happening. This is apparent when 5 books later the love interest is not only still lying to the protagonist, but getting all the friends and family to lie for him about something that directly and drastically affects her life. She technically is supposed to be the same level of power that he is, but it is very clear that was a stunt to show symbolically how much he cared for her. Because if she truly had the same power as him then the friends and family would not have lied like that, the same way they would not have lied to him. The other thing about that is she was raised to her status without any well learned political or historical education of the people she is ruling, giving the male love interest good reason to be able to over-ride anything she put into place, and not giving her enough knowledge to truly do her job. What also goes along with this is that all education on those political historical topics will have to come through him or people whom he is employing/has these strong ties with.There is a race of people which the love interest rules over who are physically and sexually abusing females, and neglecting/abusing their male children to be warriors. The love interest claims to have put laws into place to prevent this, however, he does not enforce them. Similar to how he symbolically gave the protagonist a position of power, he seemed to have symbolically put a feminist law into place but then not follow through. It is claimed the abuse they are facing is culture, and to give the males more time to change, which is obviously untrue and harmful. ‚ÄúHe will change‚Äù rhetoric harms women often. I think the way the fantasy race and issue of female violence was written was realistic, but I also think that realism is disturbing because of his unwillingness to be harsher in punishment towards males who are literally physically altering these females. It also is somewhat insinuated there is fascism going on because of his obsession with keeping one ‚Äúgood‚Äù city safe, and his distaste for the sexist race of warriors and the other city - which he oversees and is in charge of. It is almost like he believes their lives lost causes and something to be used to protect his favorite city and people, which is obviously harmful to the people who do not live in his favorite city because their ruler has abandoned them to harm in belief of culture.Again, this is a fantasy book, I do not believe this to reflect the authors beliefs on feminism or humanitarian efforts, but if you personally are looking for a high-fantasy book with a feminist love interest, this is probably not the one.Lastly, the last book has a topic of mental illness- specifically substance use issues. This book was so difficult to read as a researcher in psychology because of the abuse the protagonist faced and how she got better despite, in real life, this person would likely be far worse off. What I mean by this is the protagonist was unliked due to a disability she had in childhood, inadaptibility which is something that happens in children groomed to be married off (groomed meaning taught to be something very specific, particularly in a way of being sold to the highest bidder and marrying a wealthy male). Her sister took her meaning for life by marrying someone powerful and rich without any of the efforts and grooming which the protagonist faced in childhood, so all her trauma no longer had meaning and she no longer felt any reason to be alive. After this she developed an addiction to alcohol and began sexual risk taking behaviors. What her family did was ridicule and shame her but also enable her with money. Shame results in a cycle of wanting pleasure, so doing this was worsening her behavior. After the family got fed up with her wasting money, instead of setting boundaries and no longer buying alcohol, they threatened her life, took away her autonomy, verbally and emotionally abused her, isolated her, and then the person in charge of helping her developed a sexual relationship with her (which is supposed to be romantic but when she already struggled with risky sexual behaviors, this was taking advantage of her). On top it, a scene occurs where she essentially is noted as suicidal, and instead of helping her he continues to be short, rude, and mean to her and forced her to hike (???). And this was because she pointed out a lie which the whole family was keeping from her sister by her love interest, so the protagonist of this book was being punished for giving information which her sister had a right to know. It is just so incredibly hard to read.Of course, these people do not have psychology or mental wellness, however, I think the part I take most issue with is the unrealistic fact she gets better. Because this is a popular series I would also be concerned with people taking the idea that this sort of behavior towards someone mentally ill is romantic or okay in any way shape or form. This is fantasy, most people know that, but I feel compelled to state it anyway.‚Ä®‚Ä®Overall:I do like the books, I like the writing style, I even do not mind many of the character flaws and the big issues I mentioned occurring, it adds to moral/ethical calamity and makes you question who is the real villain or hero. But, I have seen people stating that this is a more feminist style high fantasy romance and I just wanted to point all the reasons I do not believe that to be the case.

"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean Book 1)",43.83,4.8,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.If I could I would rate it 6 stars!The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...You definitely should read this!

"Quest 2 ‚Äî Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset ‚Äî 128 GB",43.83,4.7,"First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).It was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.The first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.And there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.I made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.There's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.Also found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.It should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.I haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.I recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.And as my age indicates, fun for all ages.Oh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.

"Working Effectively with Legacy Code",43.83,4.5,"Whether taking on TDD, breaking dependencies or trying to maintain code that's lacking testing this book is a must read.Is your code a tangled mess? Are you tired of seeing telescoping methods and methods that are 100s of lines long? Want to clean up code you didn't write and get it under test but everyone's too afraid of breaking things? Does it take you forever to write unit tests? Is it painstaking and laborious? Do you write mainly integration tests because unit testing is too hard? Do you wonder how people can write lots of unit tests, let alone unit test every method? Do you want to kick your object oriented coding skills up a notch? Then this book is for you. It can teach you how to overcome all of those obstacles and so much more.For me the first roughly 100 pages of the book were a revelation. If you don't understand how to do TDD the problem probably isn't testing, it's probably the code you're trying to test or your perceptions about what it is that you are actually supposed to be testing. Michael Feathers does a great job identifying the mistakes and traps that so many developers experience when trying write and test good code and provides recipes for overcoming them. He adds clarity to what a unit test is and what it's supposed to do and in the process takes a deep dive into what good object oriented code looks like through the eyes of TDD. The book can completely change your perception about what is and is not possible.In addition to turning your perceptions about testing on their head, Feathers also provides good advice on how to create loosely coupled code, how to identify and eliminate dependencies in existing code as well as strategies for reorganizing poorly structured code into better objects. This book has clearly changed the way I code and the way I think about testing for the better. It's not just about testing it's also about turning procedural code into object oriented code and bringing your object oriented thinking to the next level.I can't say enough great things about this book. It's dearer to me than any other book in my programming collection including books about object oriented code from Bloch, Beck, Fowler and others. It wasn't until I read Working Effectively with Legacy Code that things really came together for me in the object oriented world. I got the concepts individually but failed to recognize how it all comes together. What's so great about encapsulation / getters and setter? Why is it so important to have classes and methods that do just one thing? What's so important about breaking dependencies between classes? How small is a small method? How can I ever hope to achieve open/closed? How is TDD even possible? Your mileage may vary, but if you're like me this book will change your life for the better.

"Agile Estimating and Planning",43.83,4.6,"The book is exceptionally well written. People have said that a book about anything 'Agile' should be thin - well this one is - There are about 24 chapters and each one is no more than easily digestible 20-30 pages for a quick 'agile' read. However, that does make it about 300 pages of content. But here are the 'Great' things about the book:- Well written and a light read with real pearls of wisdom- Well explained concepts with examples- Good primer on Estimation - separating 'duration' from the size and showing how/why it really matters in the long run (of the project)- Explaining when to estimate and a good 'tutorial' on planning poker and Kano Analysis for prioritizing features/desirability.- Throws light on the 'Financial Prioritization' - rubbishing the claim that features in agile teams are prioritized as per the whims and fancies of the developers.- Break downs about planning at multiple levels and what details go in them- Monitoring and communicating plans - the 'how' and 'what' to doI keep referring to the book - because it's really NOT about planning & estimating 'agile projects' - it's about how to be agile with the planning/estimating activity itself. You could use a lot of ideas (especially Kano Analysis, Planning Poker etc.,) and augment it with the approach in your organization (or your own planning exercise) to help communicate the plans/ideas more effectively.Do keep in mind, however - this is NOT a silver bullet that'd end the planning woes encountered in today's software development projects. The case study in the end is too idealistic where everybody is just 'willing' to participate and do it perfectly in lock step synchrony! (It's really difficult to find such software developers in the real world). However, the intent of the case study is to elucidate the concepts covered in the book and hence is a good summary of the ideas presented.There is nothing in the book that says what to do if the client doesn't know what he/she wants? IKIWISI = I'll know it when I'll see it - It doesn't cover anything about prototyping to get the requirements/user stories - it probably assumes that you can get them elicited with ease and moves on from there. In my opinion/experience there is a great deal of concurrency/backtracking with the initial prototyping and eliciting the user stories - an iterative exercise. Once you do those you are probably a bit better off with being able to 'guestimate' the story points.Kano Analysis has known to be around for quite a while and I was aware of it's use in KJ analysis (VOC+ KJ + Kano + Conjoint analysis that is part of the 6-sigma process) - however, it was a refreshing thought to be useful for just about every software product and it could be done without much overhead (actually the overhead is there, however, if the planning is done as a team, it'd be lighter :) Creating the questionnaire for Kano analysis itself takes some time/effort - but is easier once the stories are there. But 'shortening' it to be an 'agile' questionnaire DOES take time/effort. More so based on the feedback you get you may want to update it! But it's worth knowing and probably considering during the planning and user-story elicitation - just before prioritizing!All in all a great read with REAL practical and workable advice/knowledge!

"The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers (Robert C. Martin Series)",43.83,4.6,"Programming is an interesting profession. It‚Äôs not just an engineering exercise, where you‚Äôre building the most logical, structured, and well-designed application according to some set of industry best practices; rather, there‚Äôs a great deal of creativity that goes into it ‚Äì an artistic quality, if you will. Instead of solving a particular problem the same way for every project, you must creatively adapt your thinking and communication to meet the expectations of each project‚Äôs stakeholders. Programming is not well understood like other professions. You know what lawyers, accountants, and doctors do. Their workflows and processes are well known since their professions are mature and a good portion of the population has interacted with them directly or indirectly. Programming, on the other hand, is different. To many people, a website or software solution magically just ‚Äúappears‚Äù after a programmer spends time at his or her computer. Enter Robert C. Martin‚Äôs The Clean Coder.The Clean Coder helps demonstrate how programmers can conduct themselves as professionals, removing that black-box quality and holding themselves to standards as other professionals do so they garner the same respect from their peers and can help others do more with technology.I‚Äôll talk about some of the lessons that really resonate with me:In the forward, Matthew Heusser relays a story about how his colleague, Joe, considers ‚Äúestimates‚Äù from the technical team and ‚Äúestimates‚Äù from the legal team with completely different mindsets. In short, Joe considered legal estimates to be final, whereas technical estimates were negotiable. Why weren‚Äôt estimates from the two teams treated equally? In my career, I‚Äôve seen the same thing many times, largely stemming from three reasons. First is the assumed ‚Äúmagic‚Äù that non-technical people think programmers wield. Throughout the book, Martin explains how to remove the veil of mystery regarding said magic. Second is that I‚Äôve run across others that compared us with their profession and made some assumptions, such as, though a harsher example, we‚Äôre being lazy or noncommittal. Here, the author discusses how to address such assumptions when confronted with them. Third, and the most important part that we can influence, is the tech person‚Äôs mindset and approach to work. From the text, the programmer learns how to craft their own mindset and workflows to handle these. In essence, we can‚Äôt make things perfect, but we control a lot of parameters to make things better.The first three chapters cover the conduct that a software developer professional should exhibit. A recurring theme within all three chapters is that software developers should take responsibility for what they say and do. Martin gracefully simplified this down to: how/why to say ‚Äúno‚Äù and how/why to say ‚Äúyes.‚Äù For example, if a developer agrees to a timeline, then they should make the timeline. If there are risks or unknowns on something you‚Äôre defining a timeline for, don‚Äôt agree to it, but rather just agree to what you can commit to if possible. The key is to not let yourself get bullied into agreeing to something you know you can‚Äôt meet with confidence. Others will build their own schedules and commitments around what you say, and there may be serious repercussions and loss of face if you fail to deliver. If you‚Äôre not as accurate as possible, you‚Äôll erode the trust you have with your colleagues.Along with controlling and defining your commitments, you need to take responsibility for your work output. Specifically, being a professional means that you certify and guarantee that your work output functions. For example, accountants ensure that their accounts balance when they finish closing out the books monthly, quarterly, and year‚Äôs end. If they left discrepancies, they would soon find themselves out of work. However, developers seem to be able to deliver questionable code or features that just plain don‚Äôt work, again and again. I understand why: development is hard. There are a lot of moving pieces and people in a software development project; as a result, there are a lot of rules that get balanced when you go in and change something. None of that takes away from the fact that developers lose trust of their peers when they fail to deliver working solutions for the tasks assigned to them. They‚Äôll probably remember the failure (their label, not yours) instead of the nuanced ‚Äúwhys‚Äù that caused that failure.Luckily, software developers have tools available to them to prevent this from happening, but only if the tools are actually put to use. Martin‚Äôs philosophy around testing is something with which I completely agree. The only way you can truly know that what you‚Äôve added or changed doesn‚Äôt break everything else on a project ‚Äì regardless of size ‚Äì is to test it and have a structured, scalable approach to testing. Manual testing takes time, sometimes A LOT of time, and you leave a lot to chance that way. Hence automation. When automated, a test can be written once and then just be executed. It makes it trivial to repeatedly ensure that your code matches all the criteria it needs to meet. (Note: I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this approach across the board, particularly if an MVP, pilot system, or feature with a lot of changing specifications is being created, which is quite common with my startup customers. For something mature, scalable, and maintainable in a financially feasible manner, it‚Äôs required.)Martin‚Äôs discussion of ‚Äúexpected criteria‚Äù is another area that is really important for developers to understand and put to use. Ultimately, a customer or stakeholder will have to accept the software that a developer builds. When is the software done? What do clients judge the system‚Äôs success by? What aspects of the software do they value, and how do they prioritize what they value? To address this, I've always operated from the mindset of: the software is done when the customer tells me it's done. Part of that determination is working with the customer to define the acceptance criteria, though that can be difficult if the customer is non-technical or busy. Even high-level criteria are helpful, such as ""Search for a product, and buy it‚Äù or ‚ÄúLoad fast.‚Äù That‚Äôs fine so long as the stakeholders are open to iterations later to arrive at what they truly want. Conversely, the criteria could be very specific. Ideally, the developer helps the customer put more definition on their acceptance criteria throughout the process. The more quantitative, the better. The developer is finished with the work when they deploy or deliver the software or functionality that meets all the acceptance criteria. In conclusion, it‚Äôs not so important how the acceptance tests are written even though there are best practices; what is important is that you and the client know what is ‚Äúdone‚Äù and agree to it.The book is chock-full of other applicable advice as well, from numerically-driven ways to handle estimates to suggestions for interacting with colleagues. All of the recommendations align to the goal of helping developers comport themselves as professionals so they‚Äôll be treated as such by other professionals. It‚Äôs very important because our work is nebulous and our profession is new. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be a professional software developer for the long-term or works a lot with them.

"Foundations of Game Engine Development, Volume 1: Mathematics",43.83,4.6,"Updated again...removed my speculative errata see the books official website for errataUpdate: I have read this book all the way through a couple times now and some sections I have read repeatedly.Over those readings I have come up with some good and not so good points about the book so here they are...in no particular order...The good:1) This book is like a Lego set for 3D math. It starts with some basic pieces, then uses those pieces to build interesting 3D math parts, then uses those large pieces to build even more exotic math. Then it breaks them all down, and puts them back together to build Grassman/geometric algebra.2) The book can be educational on multiple levels, meaning that on first glance it is introducing basic stuff that you see in every book, but upon rereading I found an entire new level of detail that I missed on the first pass that aided insights to the underlying topics.3) All the stuff in the original review below. update...the books official website now has errata (thank you)Not so good:1) Some of the questions in the exercises refer to material that hasn't been introduced yet. Like question 7 in chapter one refer's to planes which aren't introduced until chapter 3. There are a few place in the book this happens. Not that big a deal but still...2) The book doesn't introduce things like converting a projection to a matrix, instead it is left as an exercise, but later in the book it uses the answer to that exercise like it was introduced. There a handful of places where the expertly crafted dialog that builds between the author and the reader break down because things like this.No matter how you slice it, this is still a 5 star book.Original review:Well edited, easy to read, and easy to follow. I'm looking forward to the next volume. This is the kind of book that keeps me passionate about computer graphics by presenting current up to date material without a bunch of redundancy. It also offers a tantalizing look into grassman/geometric algebra complete with enough implementation details to start putting the theory to use. I'm hoping the author will continue to explore this area in the other volumes of the book. (using the wedge operator with sphere's in particular) If there is anything I didn't really care for its that I felt like I was being led somewhere with the overall structure of the book and the code listings that it includes. But at the end of the book it seemed like some of these ideas were either just dropped or left up to the reader to conjure from the tables. The author recommends reading chapter 3 for experienced readers, but I would suggest starting in chapter 2, if you start falling asleep go to chapter 3 if you are lost go back to chapter 1, if chapter 1 is confusing then...segmentation fault, core dumped

"Amazon Smart Plug | Works with Alexa | control lights with voice | easy to set up and use",43.83,4.7,"The only other smart plugs and switches I have currently are all Z-wave based (about 20) and I've never had issues with any of them and have them all programmed on schedules and various alerts as well as manual control. However, obtaining Z-wave based products are getting harder and harder because it seems the market is flooded with so many off-brand plugs and switches tied to a variety of ecosystems.My preference has always been for Z-wave because those devices operate on their own wireless band outside of my 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless networks and instead communicate only to a hub that is connected to the internet. I'm still not sold on switching out my smart devices for devices that need persistent internet access and consume wireless bandwidth but do like that this device is very easy to setup and use.I currently have this in my kids' room connected to a Vornado fan that they can call upon if they want some airflow in their room and not affect anyone else. I've used a Z-wave switch for this in the past and have controlled it for them or set it on a schedule because I didn't want them to have access to the SmartThings app to be able to control that device and others.Setup and adoption were easy, maybe a little easier than SmartThings. Calling out to Alexa to control the device is intuitive and works well to set timers and basic on/off.However, now that the device is on my wifi network, I see that it uploads and downloads 1-5KB of data twice an hour starting at about 9 minutes after the hour and again 5 minutes later with an Amazon server with ""device-metrics"" in the hostname. Not sure what it's doing exactly, my guess would be exchanging telemetry data or phoning home.Overall, it's a a good smart plug that's easy to use and can be trusted to some extent if you're already using Amazon devices in your home rather than tie yourself into some other ecosystem that sends data to a foreign country.

Finally it's lightening fast and you don't have to wait for your TV smart apps to load (most TVs have very slow processors and are sluggish especially when you first turn it on) , the fire stick loads things at lightening speeds even after pressing the power to turn it on.

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"I'm not the most tech savvy, so haven't set up a ton of the features an Echo could have and don't use it for much, but it's still becoming a very helpful assistant around the house. It understands voice very well, and has a clear shut off for both the camera and microphone separately, so you know when those are shut off for privacy concerns. When you ask, it will tell you what Amazon products are being delivered today, which is very helpful if you buy a lot online. You can thank your driver with it, check your order status, and ask many different questions. Vs the google hub, I get more useful answers out of the Echo when asking specific questions, like asking when 10 days later will be, etc. Whether you have an Amazon music account or not, you can get it to play stations you like, which I've ended up using a lot as it's more convenient than turning on the Bluetooth speakers, and sound quality is good. For listening to music, the Echo is more than good enough in both volume and quality. You can also do video calls, which is a very helpful feature, both if you have multiple Echos around the house, or if you have someone on a phone with the Alexa app. And of course you can set little reminders or timers, which have become a habit very quickly due to the convenience. I have mine set up between the living room and kitchen, where we can use it in both rooms, and it's a great time and hand saver. It was extremely easy to set up, and just works, without fuss or manual updates. Great home assistant, and I know it has a lot more features to explore if I can find the time to.

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"I was stunned at how much better the picture quality is with this device vs the built in Samsung apps. I get consistent HDR quality streaming apps. I tested this by running the movie Interstellar on Amazon prime in the built in Samsung prime app and then flipped to this Amazon fire stick. Not only did the picture quality look better but the HDR worked (whereas it didn't in the built in Samsung prime app). Additionally it completely takes over your TV and soundbar with one remote. Finally it's lightening fast and you don't have to wait for your TV smart apps to load (most TVs have very slow processors and are sluggish especially when you first turn it on) , the fire stick loads things at lightening speeds even after pressing the power to turn it on.  Love it! 5 stars.

"Amazon Fire TV Stick, HD, sharp picture quality, fast streaming, free & live TV, Alexa Voice Remote with TV controls",43.83,4.7,"I just regret not having reacted earlier and bought my Amazon fire stick a long time ago, instead of paying for a cable subscription unnecessarily. The HD picture quality is sharp crisp and despite response to the commands not being as fast as cable (showing some micro-second slags with the remote) that seems to be only a very minor inconvenience, almost unnoticeable. You will get a stable signal as long as your internet service enjoys a reliable connection as well. The set up was a breeze and very straightforward and I love the minimalist design parameters of the remote, very sleek and intuitive and all you need at a simple click of your fingertips. There is obviously a learning curve into changing to full streaming services but is more about the learning experience to navigate the app and getting acquainted with the remote, getting familiar with the apps you‚Äôd like to keep and avoid getting lured into acquiring new pay streaming services unnecessary for your needs or preferences. Beware, the current streaming offer seems to be enormous, so I can see it might take you some time just organizing your preferences.The fire TV will let you organize access into separate user profiles and establishing parental controls or limited access accordingly. Overall, it proves to be a simple solution for quality streaming services at a very convenient price and a definite good bye to my regrets for paying expensive cable tv services!

"Amazon Smart Thermostat ‚Äì Save money and energy - Works with Alexa and Ring - C-wire required",43.83,4.1,"I‚Äôm a big Nest fan had it on my old house the problem that I have with them it‚Äôs the cost, and even with gas company great rebate didn‚Äôt justify the cost especially with my new home having a total of 5 thermostats (t-stat). I was excited when I found that Amazon partner with Honeywell to get this t-stat created as Honeywell has been creating t-stat for years which make me feel better when making the purchase.---COST---Now let go over the details for cost it‚Äôs good and I got two of them which at the end of the day will be free due to the electric company rebate for a smart t-stat.  I didn‚Äôt get a C- adapter and I will explain later (INSTALL session) why I purchase a 24-volt transformer for my first-floor unit.---INSTALL---Love the package it reminds me of the NEST when it first starts came with everything that you needed the only additional tools, I need was a harmer, and drill but this is normal for these installations.Now the biggest question that everyone has is the C (common) wire. This is where you need to do your research regardless of what company you go with when upgrading to a smart thermostat, due your homework on what you need. For me I have a spill unit (boiler & A/C) first for my second-floor unit it was super easy I had an extra wire and I use it for Common the t-stat startup and finish within 30 min. Now for my first floor I utilize a 24-volt transformer because I didn‚Äôt have spare cables and I didn‚Äôt want to run a new cable which drove me to make the purchase again do your homework before and see what option best works for your use case.I connected the transformer to the C wire and the other end to Rc and that works like a champ. This is critical if you have a split unit since Honeywell power their t-stat via Rc only when you have two RED Wire (R (heater) and Rc(cooling)) and the blue tab (internal jumper is down position. If you only have one RED Wire you are fine just keep the blue tab up and your t-stat will turn on without any problems.  I did reach out to Honeywell and explain to them they need to explain this on their site and white papers that when you have split units‚Äô power for the t-stat will come from Rc and not from R this is critical because my house previous owner installed a switch to keep the A/C unit down through the winter to avoid accident turning on the unit which is great idea. Please keep in mind this is NOT an Amazon problem that is Honeywell they did acknowledge their mistake and agree to update their site and documentation.Running my transformer cable and installing the unit took me about 60 minutes because I wanted to look perfect with the transformer cable going through the wall this make the installation look cleaner.----SETUP----Once all wire were connected the setup of the t-stat was simply and when I say simple it was super didn‚Äôt have input the WiFi password or anything else since it automatic joined my account that was amazing and simply just like setting a fire table that was a great experience. Amazon did an amazing job doing this some users this my not be as good, but I look automation the less click I must do the less chances of mistake A+---LOOK---The t-stat looks great after the final install the wall panel (included but optional for install) made it easier for me since I didn‚Äôt have to paint (if you had a different color paint I would recommend adjusting before completing the install but that is just me)---Interface (GUI)----For me the GUI is great for some it my but I‚Äôm one of those people that like to have one application on my phone or tablet rather than 2 and this is where Amazon did another amazing job. Please keep in mind that Google who purchase NEST is doing the same thing I see the NEST application going away in the future all new NEST is configure from Google Home and they also did a great job The GUI it‚Äôs simple and allows you to setup multiple schedules and copy them to different days or week. Huge plus on my book because for the NEST I had to do manually per day I can setup one day and copy to another. You can setup away and home schedule or utilize your current Amazon device to tell the t-stat that you are home or away. Another item that I love from the Amazon you can setup MAX cooling or heating this allows for mistake not to happen and getting your house too hot or cool really go option to have and you can set filter replacements without your assistance (optional) for me this is great no more remembering air filter as they will show up at my footsteps.Energy saving incentives can also be done via the application. The dashboard its great too it tells you how much energy you utilize each day and where you can save.Now the only downside for that I experience is only scheduling session on Android because it forces close my Alexa application all the time, I don‚Äôt have this problem with anything else on the application just the scheduling session. This option works perfect on my wife new iPhone and iPad pro and new Android phone. My old Android is the one with this problem, but I experience this kind of thing on and off since it‚Äôs an older device.-------Final judgment ----The device is good option for a smart t-stat and would recommend for anyone some of the problems that were reported it was on day one which is expected with any new launch overall I see this t-stat giving Google (NEST) and others a run for their money as now you have a great option for smart t-stat and you don‚Äôt require to break your budget to acquire one. In addition, love the one application for everything as previously mentioned all big companies are doing this model to stop the install of some many other applications. In a scale from 0 -10 this t-stat gets a 9 please note that the NEST 3rd gen got a 9 from me. Hope this helps everyone make the correct decision and I will update this review in a few weeks to report back.

"Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa | Charcoal",43.83,4.7,"I bought two of these refurbed, so I saved a ton of money. 1 echo for $100, two refurbs for $120. No brainer, and I wanted stereo off the bat. Hooked them up with Alexa, painless. Listened for an hour or so, grabbed a sub‚Ä¶needed it. By themselves, they sounded crystal clear, great mids (I‚Äôm a live sound man, mids are critical..after drums). But the low end was obviously lacking. Good for a desk in a small office, maybe, but these suckers get LOUD with zero distortion. I like the way a paired set defaults to one volume control. Nice.I got the sub, hooked it up relatively painlessly, fired up a test track, ‚ÄúRiding the Crest‚Äù by a-ha. Super deep lows, pristine mids, top notch highs. I actually hat to turn the bass down. Amazing sound.Two tips-as much as you‚Äôre tempted to hide them, don‚Äôt. They need to be out in the open. Two tweeters on the front point out in either direction, for max coverage. The mid/low speaker is on top, facing downwards a bit. Get the picture?  Stick ‚Äò‚Äòem in a bookcase or enclosed shelf, all the sound is close to completely muffled. Keep ‚Äòem out completely. Yes, they‚Äôre a ball. So are baseballs and basketballs. The whole reason for that was to use larger speakers in a wider sound pattern-something the tube style couldn‚Äôt do.The sub-no brainer. I know , Sonos is supposed to sound better. They don‚Äôt. They actually sound worse. Add in their sub with the lauded variable crossover‚Ä¶unless you‚Äôre an immediate super audiophile, it‚Äôs gonna sound like mush. That‚Äôs where Amazon was smart. The crossover between the echoes and the sub is perfect, almost seamless. One reason-they were designed that way. Now, another tip. I know countless mags and audiophiles tell you you can hide a sub anywhere.  Bull crud. They need to be out in the open. Not going into frequency science here, but the best position for the sub is about a foot out on any side-don‚Äôt stick it in a corner. It‚Äôs designed to fire out all the way around, it‚Äôs pointed toward the floor. Those little slots absolutely need to be clear all the way around. I‚Äôve got the two echoes (I kid you not) on top of a pair of highish end KRK studio monitors. The sub is on the floor, a little to the left of the left hand echo, about maybe 10 feet from my head, sub out in the open.Bam. Easily the best sounding system I‚Äôve heard in its class. Sorry, Sonos, no comparison. See ya. Of course,,my studio rig demolishes them, but to be fair, the two 8‚Äù 200watt each biamped and room tuned desktops have a range of 34hz to 40kHz. That‚Äôs about 22kHz higher than the human ear can hear. The somewhat overdone matching 400 watt sub goes all the way down to 18hz‚Ä¶the human ear stops at 32hz. So yeah, obviously sound better. Cost $1500 USD, they‚Äôd better sound better than my echoes. Jet‚Äôs be realistic here.Simply put, this little setup ain‚Äôt gonna fill a huge living room with a 72‚Äù whatdidyabuythatcrapfor?  Drop ‚Äòem an a bedroom of a decent size, or a small tv room, you will not be disappointed. One last thing‚Ä¶ people here complain about dropped signals, unpairing‚Ä¶these things run off wi-fi. They don‚Äôt directly connect, so if your router is two rooms awa with a fridge in the way, you‚Äôll be dropping signal, same as your laptop..they need to either be near the router, or at least have one or two boosters for a clear shot. I have yet to drop at all, no random unpairing, zero problems. Keep that in mind‚Ä¶even though I have a 1.2 gHz internet speed, I only get 600mHz or a bit more across the house. Get your signal path clear.  No more problems.

"bmani Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones 48hrs Play Back Sport Earphones with LED Display Over-Ear Buds with Earhooks Built-in Mic Headset for Workout Black",43.83,4.4,"The battery life on these things is kind of insane. On a full charge the case itself has lasted me almost of month with using them 20/30 days for at least 5-7 hrs a days. That being said, 5-7hrs and the earbuds themselves will only go down to maybe 60%. The fit pretty well, but wearing a cap with them on cause cause them to get a bit uncomfortable at times cause they'll start to rotate a bit, but I've never had an issue with them falling out. They were simple to connect to my phone and tablet and have had no problems with them disconnecting even after working 50ft away. Love that the case charges using USB-C since my phone uses that as well. The sound quality is pretty good considering they decently cheap earbuds, and they have decent noise cancelling when positioned correctly. Overall, they're better than expected for the price I got them at.

Only a couple of days after that, I received an email stating that my laptop screens were not repairable and I was given an Amazon card for the entire purchase price. I could not have been more pleased, as the purchase price was $599 and was a huge splurge for me in the first place. I was able to quickly replace the screens and back in business in no time. I would recommend this protection plan for any high dollar purchase.

Thank you Allure!I really love my Allure box! I appreciate the higher end selections and always find products that I love! I‚Äôm not looking for trendy products though, I‚Äôm really looking for the classics and higher end items. I  feel like sometimes it‚Äôs easy to look at the number of items in a box instead of the quality and size of the items. Fillers are a waste in my opinion; I‚Äôd cancel a subscription who tried to stretch the number of items in the box with inexpensive items before I would a subscription that brings me higher end items. In my opinion, my only hesitation with this box is that I‚Äôve seen subscribers complain that certain items are made in China and not of the same quality and price point as the ones marketed and sold from Europe...... I don‚Äôt know if this is true. If the  items are not the same, than I would not think Allure would be able to market those products with the higher value attached as that would be obviously misleading, again just my opinion. I really hope that that isn‚Äôt true. I‚Äôd like to hear Allure speak to that, in fact the future success of this box may depend on it as it seems to drawing unfavorable attention on reviews. I‚Äôm going to be optimistic for now and hope that the products are original because I‚Äôm loving the selections!

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"I've been using the all-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for several months now, and it has truly transformed my viewing experience. This streaming device boasts a fast performance that makes navigating through menus and apps a breeze, although I've noticed occasional slowdowns that require a restart to resolve. Despite this minor hiccup, the device remains highly reliable.The standout feature of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is undoubtedly its exceptional picture quality. Watching movies in 4K HDR, especially Amazon Prime titles, is a visual treat‚Äîthe clarity and color depth bring scenes to life in a way that rivals even high-end smart TVs. The sound quality also impresses, enhancing the overall cinematic experience right in the comfort of my living room.Another significant advantage is its wonderful interface. I must state that its interface is user-friendly, and all the apps I frequently use, such as Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime, Max, and Peacock, run smoothly and load quickly, which is why I find myself preferring the Fire Stick over my smart TV's built-in apps.I would rate the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max 4.5 stars out of 5. It loses half a star due to the occasional need to restart it due to slowdowns, but for its stellar picture quality, robust feature set, and ease of use, it might just as well deserve a full 5 stars. For anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment system without the hassle of cables or satellite, this device is certainly worth considering.

"Homall Gaming Chair, Office Chair High Back Computer Chair Leather Desk Chair Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)",43.83,4.4,"This is my second one of these. The first I've had for five or six years and it's pretty rough. The fabric is now coming apart on the seat cushion and more worryingly, the bolts that hold the armrests on have broken. Yes, that's right, broken. The heads break off. I'm not a heavy guy either. Speaking of which, the cushioning in this is fairly firm but good and the seat fits me we well as a smaller person. The cushions provided do help with support and in the end, I find this chair to be very comfortable especially considering the price.Back to the bolts; this has to be the worst part of the chair. They were coming loose on the armrests on my prior chair, then eventually failed at the bolt head. I see there is loctite applied from the factory on this new one; I don't remember if the old one had that and if not, it will help. However, while I was putting together the new chair using an impact driver on the lowest setting (~15 lb/ft), I managed to break one of the bolts at the head. These are clearly weak bolts and they should never snap this way, especially considering their size. In fact, the small Phillips head screws used to secure the plastic trim seem more stout. If you're careful with the bolts and expect to replace the chair in 3 years or so, I think this is a good buy.

I work from home, go to grad school and I like to game and write in my spare time. I have back issues due to a congenital condition, so a comfortable and supportive chair is very important. I sprang for this one because I really, really needed a better chair than the one I had. I'm not the best at putting things together without a visual like a video,  but the instructions were clear and very easy to follow. I was able to put it together myself, shaking hands, motor control issues and all!The chair is so comfortable and feels sturdy when I sit in it. I have really long legs and the seat itself doesn't feel too short to me at all. The foot rest is a fantastic feature; I will say that it's a bit shorter than I will like, but I chalk that up to my legs being so long. Even with that, putting my feet up at work and being able to recline is a godsend on long days. The armrests feel sturdy and come up to a comfortable height. I tried the massaging lumbar support; it was a bit loud but it's by no means a deal breaker.If you're on a budget and are looking for a gaming or office chair, I would recommend this one for sure! If my husband likes it, I may even get him one.

There was no number left to call back and clarify this issue, and the service manager read off only what the service provider had written, ""replace video card,"" and merely provided the comment that they replaced the video card, and would try again.Additionally, it was mentioned there is a limit on repair attempts, as if I was at fault for the way the machine was returned to me, and they would allow one more attempt at repair, even though the machine was not repaired the first attempt.And that repair?

"NEO CHAIR Office Chair Computer Desk Chair Gaming - Ergonomic High Back Cushion Lumbar Support with Wheels Comfortable Ivory Leather Racing Seat Adjustable Swivel Rolling Home Executive",43.83,4.2,"This chair is very comfortable and looks great. It was very easy to assemble. It took maybe around 45 minutes to do it because of the different screws and pieces but it was nothing complicated at all.  It is made well and sturdy and strong. I was very pleased and really surprised because when I ordered it was shipped out only a few hours later and I received it the next day! I thought that was impressive and important to mention. The only slight issue that I had was the first step in the instructions that came with it regarding the image. It appears to me that the base of the chair (the silver part) has screw holes on top and that is not correct, the screw holes go on the bottom and if someone puts it together going by the image instead of thinking it through, they're going to have an issue. Overall, I would recommend it to others and I plan to order another one for my office. I am extremely satisfied and it's been a great product!

"N-GEN Video Gaming Computer Chair Ergonomic Office Chair Desk Chair with Lumbar Support Flip Up Arms Adjustable Height Swivel PU Leather Executive with Wheels for Adults Women Men (Blue)",43.83,4.4,"I got this chair to replace my current gaming chair that I also use for working remotely. I spend most of my day glued to my desk in my chair, so it was important that I got a comfortable chair that'll last me a while. My last chair didn't have the best seat so I definitely needed an upgrade. I've used this chair and I can immediately tell the difference in how comfortable it is. Here are some details:ASSEMBLY: Super quick and simple, great quality hardware and feels sturdy right off the bat. The tools inclued in are also great quality for the price. Less than 20 minutes.MATERIALS: One thing I noticed was how nice the faux leather is. It's not the type to crumble and peel. It's soft, not too shiny, thick, and feels really nice to sit with shorts on (!!!). Doesn't collect sweat. Pretty important during the Summer.COMFORT: It's got a nice thick seat and it's actually got pretty decent back support that I wasn't expecting. It kept me upright for most of my work day and felt way better after almost a 13 hour day too. Really loving it so far. The seat itself actually supports you too with how it's shaped.WHEELS: An important part to people with carpets (me). It rolls well and doesn't have a mind of it's own. Not flimsy. The base is also made out of metal which was an upgrade for me as well.DESIGN: It looks great too. The seat is bigger than I thought and decently high back too. With it being spacious for me, it still doesn't have any extra bulk which is nice. The addition of the nice textured leather on the all black chair is also great aesthetics.10/10 recommended. It's a GREAT value for what you get at this price point.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"I think that Blink support is great they actually tried to reach out to me when I posted a negative review. So for that effort in them wanting to help I give the company 5 stars. As for the product itself I give 3 stars because it picks up everything even a tree branch on a tree moving. I hate to see what will happen with my blink when a wind storm comes through. Last night it picked up a wolf coming through my yard. With Ring it only picked up people and packages which is what I want a video doorbell to do. I left Ring because of the price hike they did this year. They went from $30 to $49 a yr and I would have paid a small hike and counted it as inflation but that big of a hike and Im gone.I had made a negative feedback originally because I could not get my chime to work. Well I got a professional to come out and fix it and come to find out it was because I just mounted it to the wall and expected it to work but I did not know you also have to go through all the steps in the app to get the chime to work. When I went through all the steps it started working. I would like to get in touch with support again because I cant get the blink doorbell to work with my echo shows like my ring doorbell did

¬†If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped.

¬†I'm stupid for music and have as hard a time deciding on my setup as I do choosing medicare plans. Yeah I'm old.There's plenty of videos out there discussing the virtues of all devices and you would do well to watch first.So...I have a M series Vizio 5.1 sound bar, subwoofer and satellites in the house. It sounds great. If I was smart I'd just stick with it.Outside there's a V series Vizio and it also sounds good but it a bit dated. Still the sound is adequate, but I'm looking for more and not ready to spend $700.00 for a new 5.1.2. Maybe someday.I have 2 echos 4th gen with a subwoofer and set them up outside in the perfect spots and was pretty impressed. If you're not a weirdo like me this will be fine. If you want to be minimalist 1 would be fine. Not a lot of room, echo 4th would be fine. 2 together with subwoofer is far better.So now I have a refurbished studio that I've been staring at for a year in the Amazon app. One day it went on sale so I got it for a price that wouldn't hurt my feelings if it didn't turn out ok.Setup was generally without issue. There was a small problem pairing with subwoofer, but that was eventually resolved by making sure both were on 2.4 network and resetting the sub.First go I listened to smooth jazz, yacht rock, classical and there was something missing. Asked it to play spacial playlist and Ed Sheeran came out Chrystal clear. Very nice, but not really my genre.This morning I started out with BBC News and NPR and was not impressed. Same with smooth jazz. So I went into setting and tweaked the equalizer and turned off spacial, which is set to on default out of box. The difference is significant and there are YouTube experts that tell you to do this.Another thing. I set the studio up on a higher shelf and found when I spoke, it didn't hear me but the echo 4th gen in the house did. I pulled the studio down to a table and the microphones pick up everything fine.Spacial is a limited catalogue in Amazon and you can tell Studio to play that genre, but for me, not to interested. You can listen to Dolby Atmos etc without spacial.So keep in mind this is not stereo system for audiophiles. It's a Bluetooth/streaming device and it works great for that. In most circumstances this is all normal people would need. I see myself getting another when the price comes back down, maybe black Friday. I expect to change this to 5 stars when I have 2 paired with a sub.In the past I've tried pairing with Firestick and the results were nowhere as good as 5.1 and had issues. These are great devices for specific things and a good choice for most circumstances.My friend was just here and blown away, but he's not a weirdo like me.December 3 2023 updateI took the punge and purchased another refurbed unit at black friday sales price I couldn't pass up. Pairing the new one with the existing studio and sub was not seamless, but took about 15 minutes. JI like it a great deal. The volume is far more than I can do without annoying the neighborhood. The music is clear and there are no connectivity issues. As always certified by Amazon products are just fine and at $60.00 savings I can't go wrong.As a test I streamed music from Amazon music app on firestick 4k on Vizio 5.1 V series on the patio that is about 400 square feet. Sounds good. Then I streamed from the studios and sounded great. I had my neighbor come over to get his opinion and he liked studio sound better than Vizio. No doubt there are differences in what the stick can do that the studio can do better. A comparable sound bar setup would cost between $500-$1000. I'm just not willing to do that yet.In the house I have a vizio 5.1 M series and I like it a lot.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
¬†If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped.

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"I've been using the all-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for several months now, and it has truly transformed my viewing experience. This streaming device boasts a fast performance that makes navigating through menus and apps a breeze, although I've noticed occasional slowdowns that require a restart to resolve. Despite this minor hiccup, the device remains highly reliable.The standout feature of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is undoubtedly its exceptional picture quality. Watching movies in 4K HDR, especially Amazon Prime titles, is a visual treat‚Äîthe clarity and color depth bring scenes to life in a way that rivals even high-end smart TVs. The sound quality also impresses, enhancing the overall cinematic experience right in the comfort of my living room.Another significant advantage is its wonderful interface. I must state that its interface is user-friendly, and all the apps I frequently use, such as Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime, Max, and Peacock, run smoothly and load quickly, which is why I find myself preferring the Fire Stick over my smart TV's built-in apps.I would rate the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max 4.5 stars out of 5. It loses half a star due to the occasional need to restart it due to slowdowns, but for its stellar picture quality, robust feature set, and ease of use, it might just as well deserve a full 5 stars. For anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment system without the hassle of cables or satellite, this device is certainly worth considering.

Flavors vary greatly based on the season and each box has a theme. There are two of (almost) everything so it's particularly fun to share with a friend or loved one. Reading + snacking + googling more info about the ingredients and areas makes for a fun date night activity.

¬†I'm stupid for music and have as hard a time deciding on my setup as I do choosing medicare plans. Yeah I'm old.There's plenty of videos out there discussing the virtues of all devices and you would do well to watch first.So...I have a M series Vizio 5.1 sound bar, subwoofer and satellites in the house. It sounds great. If I was smart I'd just stick with it.Outside there's a V series Vizio and it also sounds good but it a bit dated. Still the sound is adequate, but I'm looking for more and not ready to spend $700.00 for a new 5.1.2. Maybe someday.I have 2 echos 4th gen with a subwoofer and set them up outside in the perfect spots and was pretty impressed. If you're not a weirdo like me this will be fine. If you want to be minimalist 1 would be fine. Not a lot of room, echo 4th would be fine. 2 together with subwoofer is far better.So now I have a refurbished studio that I've been staring at for a year in the Amazon app. One day it went on sale so I got it for a price that wouldn't hurt my feelings if it didn't turn out ok.Setup was generally without issue. There was a small problem pairing with subwoofer, but that was eventually resolved by making sure both were on 2.4 network and resetting the sub.First go I listened to smooth jazz, yacht rock, classical and there was something missing. Asked it to play spacial playlist and Ed Sheeran came out Chrystal clear. Very nice, but not really my genre.This morning I started out with BBC News and NPR and was not impressed. Same with smooth jazz. So I went into setting and tweaked the equalizer and turned off spacial, which is set to on default out of box. The difference is significant and there are YouTube experts that tell you to do this.Another thing. I set the studio up on a higher shelf and found when I spoke, it didn't hear me but the echo 4th gen in the house did. I pulled the studio down to a table and the microphones pick up everything fine.Spacial is a limited catalogue in Amazon and you can tell Studio to play that genre, but for me, not to interested. You can listen to Dolby Atmos etc without spacial.So keep in mind this is not stereo system for audiophiles. It's a Bluetooth/streaming device and it works great for that. In most circumstances this is all normal people would need. I see myself getting another when the price comes back down, maybe black Friday. I expect to change this to 5 stars when I have 2 paired with a sub.In the past I've tried pairing with Firestick and the results were nowhere as good as 5.1 and had issues. These are great devices for specific things and a good choice for most circumstances.My friend was just here and blown away, but he's not a weirdo like me.December 3 2023 updateI took the punge and purchased another refurbed unit at black friday sales price I couldn't pass up. Pairing the new one with the existing studio and sub was not seamless, but took about 15 minutes. JI like it a great deal. The volume is far more than I can do without annoying the neighborhood. The music is clear and there are no connectivity issues. As always certified by Amazon products are just fine and at $60.00 savings I can't go wrong.As a test I streamed music from Amazon music app on firestick 4k on Vizio 5.1 V series on the patio that is about 400 square feet. Sounds good. Then I streamed from the studios and sounded great. I had my neighbor come over to get his opinion and he liked studio sound better than Vizio. No doubt there are differences in what the stick can do that the studio can do better. A comparable sound bar setup would cost between $500-$1000. I'm just not willing to do that yet.In the house I have a vizio 5.1 M series and I like it a lot. Echo show 10 for casual listening.The thing that would make the studio amazing is surround speakers, still as it is I'm pretty happy. Changing 5 stars.

"Certified Refurbished Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa | Twilight Blue",43.83,4.6,"First off, you can buy two refurbished for a bit more than one new one. $120 vs $100. They sound killer. Get the sub. You‚Äôre gonna be happy. I suggest this model with the sub-they‚Äôre designed to match. The crossover between the Echo and the sub is seamless. Perfectly matched. No adjustment needed. The Alexa app is really well planned out. Plug the Echoes in, combine them to stereo, pick a room. Done. There‚Äôs been a ton of complaints about teo things. Random disconnects‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre like me, you might have 5 or 6 wifi devices in your room, with a wall or two between you and your router. It‚Äôs not a problem with the Echo-your router probably can‚Äôt handle the load. Check with your ISP for a newer model. With most of my gear on all over the place, even my ridiculously priced laptop runs at maybe half speed or less.  Got a better router that could support 50 devices at once, problem solved. These run over wifi. I‚Äôve only had a dropped connection problem once since i got them in February. Keep two of them a decent distance between, the seperation is amazing. ( side note-i don‚Äôt care what anybody tells you-don‚Äôt stick the sub behind something and right next to a wall. At least a foot away from a wall, and out in the open. The difference is really noticeable. I won‚Äôt bore you with details, look online. It absolutely needs that space)Yes, a lot of reviews say the Sonus sub is better. It‚Äôs also $750 USD. It‚Äôd better be an improvement. Get real. The issue with the Sonus is the variable crossover, so it‚Äôll work with any speakers. But unless you‚Äôre a genius with a frequency meter, the Sonus sounds muddy, creeps up into the sat speaker range, basically killing off the low end. I only say this  because i owned a setup. My decades old Pioneers sounded better. $1200 wasted. Returnef them. The big sellimg point?  The Echo setup only goes down to 35hz. The Sonus goes down to 28hz. Makes zero difference. Nada. Not enough to justify the massive price difference. For what it‚Äôs worth, the subs in my main revording room go down to 18hz. At half the price, and are way more accurate. Anyway.Grab these while you can. Yes, the ball shape is ‚Äúugly‚Äù??? It‚Äôs round. The design is much better acoustically than the tall tubes. Way better. Are they gonna fill a good sized tv room? Not really, just not enough power, but in a smaller room, they‚Äôre perfect.Sorry about the long read. I‚Äôm a live ‚Äúsoundman‚Äù, been since‚Äô93. I have a good ear-i have to. It‚Äôs my income. Over more expensive setups, this is near the top of my list.Buy and enjoy!!

"Amazon Fire TV Stick, HD, sharp picture quality, fast streaming, free & live TV, Alexa Voice Remote with TV controls",43.83,4.7,"I have used Fire Sticks for quite a while.  Recently I learned that the peripheral cable boxes for Xfinity could be replaced with Fire Sticks and the Xfinity app.  Since they charge a monthly fee for all of these boxes it is a significant cost savings per year once the cost of the Fire Stick is deducted.  It is also a more streamlined installation (see photo of cable box installation on the left compared with Fire Stick for same service on the right).  A third advantage is the durability, ease of operation, and responsiveness of the Fire Stick compared with the Xfinity remotes.  We found that we were regularly replacing the Xfinity remotes and that newer versions did not have codes that allowed the remotes to control on-off or volume on the television.  Fire Sticks have never caused that problem.  The end result is a better engineered product at a significant cost savings.

In a small town, the unsolved grisly murder of a five year old resonates, becomes the stuff of legends.Behind that legend, there are real people, though.Margot Davies was friends with January, an across the street neighbor and playmate of January. Twenty years later, grown up Margot returns to town to care for her uncle, Luke, who suffers from early onset dementia. Luke, who was always like a father to her. A man without kids of his own who had always wanted them.Just after her arrival in town, a young girl from a neighboring town goes missing and is soon found dead, in a manner similar to January‚Äôs death. And so Margot starts to poke around. She believes the cases to be related and becomes obsessed with finding the killer.But in a town like Wakarusa, where everyone is friendly and god fearing, it becomes evident that nobody is telling the whole truth.There‚Äôs Billy and Krissy, parents of twins January and Jace, there‚Äôs adult Jace, Dave their high school buddy, Pete the local police officer, and countless others wound up in this tight, intense thriller.This is tough. It fits the bill as a tight story. There are twists and turns, red herrings and hidden clues. Ultimately though, it didn‚Äôt stick the ending. The actual ending is fine, could be satisfying as far as tying up loose ends, but the culprit doesn‚Äôt fit. The person described in the flashback wasn‚Äôt described as so angry and heartless in the rest of the story. It feels out of character. If only a few more hints of that evil had been tossed into the earlier narrative, I would have felt better about the end.

"The Women: A Novel",43.83,4.8,"Kristin Hannah‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù is an inspiring, powerful, and well written journey of women nurses serving in the Vietnam war and their challenges of PTSD when reintegrating back into the tumultuous society of the late 1960‚Äôs, early 1970‚Äôs when people at home told them ‚ÄúNo women were in Vietnam‚Äù.  It is told through the main character of nurse Lt. Frankie McGrath, a young, naive, and coming of age woman from Coronado, CA.Frankie‚Äôs journey from the beaches of Coronado, CA to her following her brother into the military, her parents and her expectations, the training, her experiences in getting to Vietnam, earning the trust of her colleagues and medical professionals while serving, the camaraderie, the relationships, the realism of war and the lack of respect for serving when home will ALL ring true to any ‚ÄúIn-Country‚Äù Vietnam veteran.Kristin Hannah‚Äôs style of writing, the riveting and realistic descriptions of the challenges of nursing in a combat zone and the idealism to be an Army nurse in the 1960‚Äôs are so authentic. Then, the intensity of Kristin Hannah‚Äôs ‚Äúwar stories‚Äù detailing the gritty service at the 36th Evac Hospital at Vung Tau and the 71st Evac Hospital in the Central Highlands in Pleiku are so realistic, so moving and so relatable.An example: ‚ÄúOutside, the whump-whump of the helicopters was defending. Frankie and Barb ran past the helipad, where the wounded were being offloaded from a Dust Off and coming in by ambulance. Men covered in mud and blood, working, shouting at one another beneath the womping rotors. In the air, a row of helicopters hovered, waited their turn to touch down‚Äù describing a mass casualty event for their medical team when helicopters were landing during a major enemy offensive.Parts of ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù read like Diane Carlson Evans memoir ‚ÄúHealing Wounds‚Äù and informed by Diane‚Äôs experiences as a U.S. Army nurse from service in the same areas of Vietnam. Diane Carlson Evans is the founder of the Vietnam Women‚Äôs Memorial at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC.‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù is very relatable to any Vietnam veteran who served at that time and anyone that lived thru the 1960‚Äôs-1970‚Äôs, especially women. ‚ÄúWomen Can Be Heroes‚Äù and the Vietnam era continues to matter!-Bill Shugarts, Vietnam Veteran (1969-1970) 23rd Infantry Division-Americal, National Park Service Master Docent at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Church Military Ministry Leader, Fawn Lake Veterans Group Co-Founder.March 2024

"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)",43.83,4.8,"I seriously don't even know where to begin with this review because all I want to do is fangirl so hard over how much I ADORED this book! Seriously people...every single word, every single scene is so gorgeously written and breathtaking that I had to stop multiple times while I was reading just to admire and appreciate what I just read. This book was absolutely excellent on so many levels that no words can do it justice (but I'm going to try because this is a review after all haha). I don't think it's any secret that Sarah J. Maas is an amazeballs author, but in case you need a reminder, just read this book and you will see the supreme talent this woman has. She could write a phone book and I would read it because somehow even that would be an amazing read. I've only said this about 1 or 2 other authors, but it's completely true.‚ÄúThere are different kinds of darkness,‚Äù Rhys said. I kept my eyes shut. ‚ÄúThere is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.‚Äù I pictured each. ‚ÄúThere is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.‚ÄùThis book made me feel so many different things at once, and literally it has it ALL! There are amazing twists, snarky banter, beautiful writing, and just plain badass, awesome characters that you want to be best friends with. After finishing this book all I want to do is be in the Night Court and be apart of Rhysand's inner circle. It's probably unhealthy how badly I want this to happen right now. But even more, SJM wrote scenes bursting with heart-pounding action, swoonworthy romance (which be warned, will leaving you squeeing), and female empowerment...GAH! I NEVER wanted to stop reading. But you know what I loved the most? Even though this story is a romance, it is also a story of self-discovery.‚ÄúI was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless againI would not, could not be broken.‚ÄùFeyre goes through so much and is incredibly strong. She is extremely relatable because even though she loses herself for a bit, she finds that inner fire that she once had and it causes a spark to ignite within her. She becomes even more amazing than her character was previously, and finds herself on her own. Feyre is such an admirable and relatable character. I mean who among us hasn't felt lost at one point or the other in their life?? Feyre shows everyone that you have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength to rise above and accept the past, and never let that thing that caused you to be lost define you. We need to embrace the pain and the anguish that came with the hand life has dealt, and choose to move forward in life...or we will remain lost. The character development for Feyre was seriously one of the best character development's I have ever read, and I think SJM deserves a HUGE round of applause for giving all readers this character. She becomes stronger and more determined than ever to accomplish what she has set out to do. All the while she remains the stubborn and sassy character we love.‚ÄúI was not prey any longer, I decided as I eased up to that door.And I was not a mouse.I was a wolf.‚ÄùRhysand...literally I have no words for my love. My heart (and ovaries) were literally bursting with every word he said. He broke my heart multiple times, and there was one scene in particular where I was gross sobbing when he was revealing things to Feyre. He still remains that mysterious Dark Lord, but we are able to understand and see so much more of him than ever before. Like Feyre, Rhys grew so much in this novel, and I loved watching how he became a little less broken due to Feyre's presence in his life. Feyre provides a nice balance to Rhys, and they're banter is like no other. We all know how shameless a flirt Rhys is, but boy does he step it up in this book...and I loved every single second of it. He had me laughing so hard countless times, and I can't even tell you how much I love him.The world that SJM has created is simply phenomenal, and I seriously don't know how she came up with her ideas, but let's just thank whoever that she did. There is so much to this world that we didn't know, and I loved learning so many new things over the course of the book. We visit more courts and see different races. We see the political uneasiness that ultimately exists in this world, and how alliances can change at the drop of a hat. And then comes the ending...it is brutal and ripped my heart out, but it left me begging for more! For the entire conclusion I basically had my jaw permanently dropped and then my heart torn out because of the events that SJM wrote. But all I know is that I can't wait to see where she takes this series in the next book because there are truly endless possibilities!‚ÄúTo the stars who listen‚Äîand the dreams that are answered.‚ÄùIf you couldn't tell already, you need to read this book as soon as possible because this is the best book of 2016 so far!Happy reading :)

"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 4)",43.83,4.3,"‚≠êÔ∏è: 4.25/5üå∂Ô∏è: 2/5Ummmm am I an ACOFAS girly now??? All the sudden, this novella has become my favorite book in the series without me realizing it.This re-read, I took the time to critically analyze ACOFAS, and really started to understand just how important this book is to the series. In Frost and Starlight, we get our lodestone character development which, in my opinion, is the foundation for the next phase of the entire series. We get deeper looks internally at characters' struggles, all set within a simple, relatively positive setting of the solstice holiday. This contrast helps highlight the development occurring within each character so that it's the main focus.We also get a lot of foreshadowing. If you've read the next book in the series, ACOFAS tees up so much without us realizing it. I believe it actually sets up even more than we realize, given that books past ACOSF haven't yet been published.The spice was minimal, and okay. I rated it 2/5 just because there were multiple scenes, but they are relatively tame!I think this was such an enjoyable read because had brevity and levity, but we still got so many breadcrumbs, I was left satisfied. It's a great break in the series, and an absolutely critical read--don't skip it over!

"House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, 1)",43.83,4.7,"Being the fan of an author's work is both a blessing and a curse.  You count down the days until their next‚Äîusually hyped up‚Äîrelease is to be published.  You talk about it more and more the closer that said release day approaches.  You try to enter any possible pre-order special is available, in the hope of getting a lovely exclusive pin, or a poster, or a print.And then the book releases...I don't know about you, but once that book hits shelves, I am violently torn between a crazed eagerness to read it, and a nearly crippling fear that I am going to hate the book no matter how much I have loved this author's stories in the past.  Which, let's face it, is one of the worst things to happen in a reader's life.Thank you, Maas, for delivering the goods once again.House of Earth and Blood is not a perfect novel.  I'm not even sure that such a thing is possible, to be frank, because our love of books is a very personal thing.  But, this novel is a punch to the heart, in the best possible way.  I absolutely fell in love with the story, with the characters, with the world that was created.  And it is definitely a complex and intricate world of which we get a glimpse, but that is sure to open up to us even more, and I cannot wait to continue exploring it as the series progresses.I'm a huge fan of badass female leads in novels.  What can I say, I live vicariously through them.  Ironically, I usually don't like so-called ‚Äúbadass‚Äù female leads in novels, because most of the time what we're given are annoying females that try too hard.  I initially read the sample for HoEaB that NetGalley provided, and I was a bit unsure about Bryce.  She came off a tad strong for me, and I was instantly worried that this meant negativity throughout the rest of the novel.  Maybe my mindset was not in its proper place then, but I am so glad that I decided to read the full novel from the first chapter again, because my opinion of Bryce completely changed.I love this woman.Despite the fact that we are reading a fantasy, despite the fact that Bryce is half-Fae, she is very human in her actions and emotions.  She makes her mistakes, she suffers through them, she learns, she picks herself back up, puts on a new pair of teal-colored panties, and she keeps going.  She's believable and realistic in who she is, and it's very easy to become connected to her.This is actually true of the rest of the characters.  They don't always connect right away‚ÄîI was unsure of Hunt at first, of Ruhn, of Jesiba even‚Äîbut once they do, they stick and you root for these people.  You suffer with them, you are excited alongside them, you want them to kick ass and come out winning on the other side.Hunt‚Äîor as I like to think of him in my head, Orion...such a gorgeous name‚Äîhad one of the best evolutions.  I can see that Maas wanted to make him this dark, introverted being at the beginning, and I saw hints of it, but I couldn't quite see him that way full-force.  I think that's one of the things that made me question him for those first few chapters of his appearance in-story.  I see what you want me to see, because you're telling me what to see, but that's not really who he is, and that's coming out more so than the facade he's portraying.  Athie is a deep, tortured, sweet and loving male who slowly opens up to the reader, and he swept me right off my feet.That's probably why the sudden twist at the end of the novel's third part was such a slap to the face, and the biggest problem that I had with this book.We're navigating a story that's centered around the death of Bryce's best friend, Danika, and her pack of shape-shifting wolves‚Äîone of the most heartbreaking moments of the book, by the way, even if the synopsis warns us about it (the writing in this piece, at the start, was wonderfully done and it tore through me).  Eventually, we know that Danika's death, and that of the pack, is surrounded by the use of a drug called synth, which makes people‚Äîboth human and non‚Äîhave strength and violence to such a degree that they can tear others apart.  And the culmination of that is that Hunt is involved in this so that he, and those with him, can use this drug to help themselves be freed from those who have enslaved them.It did not fit with his character.Hunt, who strives to keep others safe, who works and does the horrible things that his handler, Micah, tells him to do so that he can keeps streets safe?  Hunt, who deals in killing demons that come through rifts?  Yes, he has been suffering for over two hundred years, and he has been tortured within an inch of his life, and the love of his life was killed in the midst of this.  But to make him be a buyer, when he comes to know the consequences of the usage of synth, did not fit in with who he is.  As the last part of the novel progressed, things were smoothed out a bit and it sort of fit in.  But this nagged at me so much that I was not able to let it go.I did, as a matter of fact, stop reading for the day once I hit this point, and had to force myself to pick up the book again the next day so that I could continue.It doesn't take away from the story, mind you.  I said it once, and I say it again, I love this book.  I felt every single emotion that was in here, and that's one of the best things that I can ever ask for in a story: make me feel.  And you certainly feel.  You feel to the point of tears sometimes.  Lehabah's end did it for me, that little fire sprite was one of the good ones.  Bryce's phone call to Hunt when she's in the middle of taking out demons after the Gates open and knows she might very well die, did it for me again.  Danika and Bryce's reunion after Bryce makes her Drop did it for me a third time.  And then that bittersweet moment, near the end of the book, when Bryce gets just a glimpse of the pack and Connor waves to her, brought tears to my eyes once again.But I still think that there is, and was, so much to explore.  And while we're taken to the brink of those moments that can be darker, like the ones that Hunt described having experienced during his years with Sandriel alongside Pollux, we're not taken there.  It's not that I want to see my beloved characters suffer, it's that sometimes that suffering can have room for that much more growth.  Sometimes when we bypass that, things appear a little too easy.At the end of the day, though, this was stellar.  My worry was for nothing, and I am going to be suffering until the second book is so much as announced.  I'm still not over the losses in this first installment, I still remember the epic scene of Bryce against Micah, of Hunt's plummet over that helicopter, of Lehabah's sacrifice.  I am so curious to see how the obscure Aidas ties in with this story and what more he has to offer, and I can't even imagine how the Asteri will likely play a part in the future of this world.Bring it on, Crescent City.  I'm waiting.

"The Teacher",43.83,4.3,"I think we have all heard this same story before. Handsome older teacher charms young impressionable teenage girl. He gets in over his head and aims to protect himself and his career. However, in typical Frieda fashion this story takes many interesting twist on a age old saga. The twist left at the very end was what saved this story in my opinion. Had it not been for that my rating would be lower. Not because this story wasn't well written or a fun read, but because it is one we have heard and been beaten over the head with so many times. But of course Fredia didn't let me down. That being said, it is sad stories like these are common place in a way. Sad that so many young kids are taken advantage of by adults with authority that they should be able to trust. Public schools seem to be worse and worse for this sort of thing amongst other problematic issues. If at all possible it is looking better and better to Homeschool your children. But that being said, I give this book a 6.7/10 stars.

"The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles",43.83,4.5,"Warning: Very long review. This book has helped me multiple times. In The Art of War, Sun Tzu coined the famous phrase ‚Äòknow your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.‚ÄôIn The War of Art, Steven Pressfield launches into a similar discussion. In the first section we will discover our enemy: Resistance. The second section discusses our means for combat: Turning Pro. In the third and final section we will see that the battle is between our Self and our Ego.Resistance ‚Äì Defining the Enemy. This is the first of 3 sections Pressfield shares with us on what he considers to be the enemy of the creator. Resistance is an internal force, the ‚Äòenemy within.‚Äô Defined as self-sabotage, resistance usually manifests as avoidance, procrastination, or inaction caused by fear which creates paralysis. Resistance, according to Pressfield, is invisible, insidious, implacable, internal, impersonal and universal. He elaborates on each of these adjectives (and more), unafraid to use a clever metaphor or simile to illustrate a point. For example, in the section ‚ÄòResistance is infallible, Pressfield writes:‚ÄúLike a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North-meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing.‚ÄùPressfield goes on to point out Resistance in its many guises: the way peers may be recruited as allies of Resistance when an artist starts to conquer Resistance; the people around her ‚Äúbegin acting strange‚Ä¶they are trying to sabotage her‚Äù because they are experiencing Resistance of their own. They may begin to feel guilty for not trying to reach their own potential To make themselves feel better, they pressure her either directly or indirectly to backslide. In my case, I have a couple of people who point out how hard I work, don‚Äôt I need to take some me time? That sort of thing‚Ä¶.Resistance also encourages the artist‚Äôs tendency to quit at 99%, procrastinating work in order to not face completion of their work. Completion opens our work up to our peers for review and examination of others. He states that Resistance has no power of its own, only power it receives from our fear.Any one reading it will be able to identify where Resistance has dug it‚Äôs claws in at one time or another with many of his examples and definitions. I want to point out that nowhere in his book does Pressfield address the Resistance we also face via the internet, email, Facebook, etc. In one section he mentions completely missing Watergate because he was too busy writing. Apparently he is able to focus on his work so strongly these things that distract many of us have no appeal to him.The second section covers: Combating Resistance ‚Äì Turning Pro. According to Pressfield, there‚Äôs no mystery about turning pro. You just make the decision and by an act of your will it is so. By turning pro, Pressfield is talking about the ideal of becoming a professional, a mindset. You make a decision to sit down and do your craft, or exercise, or whatever, NO MATTER WHAT. No matter what tries to distract you and stop you, you keep going until the day is done. You are professional in your dedication and behavior. ‚ÄúAn amateur plays for fun, a professional for keeps.‚Äù The amateur lets a cold or minor distractions stop him. The professional knows he needs to do the work, and then get better. The amateur thinks he can quit anytime it gets tough and go back to something else. The professional doesn‚Äôt want to quit every time he hits a problem, he has discipline and determination to steady him.Turning pro means basically to prepare a work discipline and follow it. To paraphrase Pressfield‚Äôs definition: A pro shows up every day no matter what, stays on the job all day, and is in it for the long haul. For the pro, the stakes are high. Pros accept payment for their work (even if they don‚Äôt always make an income). Pros also master the technique of their work, have a sense of humor about their jobs, and receive real-world praise or blame. He explains the hangovers and colds and other things as excuses we use to deflect ourselves from our purpose and from fulfilling our call. An added benefit, if you really love what you do, you will be like a child who looks up from their activities to be surprised to find that it‚Äôs time for supper.Also, Pressfield makes a point that we are not to get our identity from the thing we are trying to create. You are still you. Your work should be work, not you. Aside from your calling, your life‚Äôs work, you should have an identity that stands alone. If you only have an identity in whatever you are trying to create, you leave yourself vulnerable to the attacks that will come. You will take it all personally and it should never be that way. Your work is what is being attacked, and you should be able to stand back and defend it objectively. Do not over invest your emotional well being in your success or failure. I think this is a common mistake made.You, Inc. ‚Äì Pressman also brings up the benefits of making yourself a corporation. Even if you only think of yourself in this way it can reinforce the idea of professionalism in your work because it separates the artist-doing-the-work from the consciousness-running-the-show. I love his idea of having status meetings with himself. In corporate America, we have a status meeting every Monday morning, decide on a plan of action and who will take care of what part of that plan, then divvy out the assignments, type it up and distribute it to the various participants. He has one of those meetings with himself every Monday. He sits down and goes over his assignments, decides when to be responsible for what, and types it up and distributes it to himself. Sometimes as Joe-blow he is too intimidated to go out and pimp himself, but as Joe-blow Inc, he enjoys the pimping. He‚Äôs not him anymore. He‚Äôs Me, Inc.This third and final section talks about the muses and identifies the cause of Resistance through the Self and the Ego. Muses, angels, demons, geniuses, an input from the collective unconsciousness, all these Pressfield calls our allies, ‚Äúequal and opposite powers‚Ä¶counterpoised against [Resistance].‚Äù These allies join us when we make the shift from being an amateur to a professional.In the second section, he heavily stresses professionalism. He states the most important thing about art is work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.‚ÄúWhen we sit down day after day and keep grinding‚Ä¶The muse takes note of our dedication. She approves‚Ä¶we becomes like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come.‚ÄùFollowing this simple but powerful truth, Pressfield talks about the day he finished his first book. He finally wrote, The End. He received this sage advice from his friend Paul: ‚ÄúGood for you. Start the next one today.‚Äù In my words: don‚Äôt stop now, you finally have a work ethic that is producing your art.Now: Ego and Self, and the battle between the two. Resistance has its seat in Ego. The Ego is that part of the psyche that believes in material existence, is concerned with its own preservation and comfort, with stasis and the physical, material world. The Ego likes things the way they are. It likes to be in control.The Self, according to Pressfield, is where we grow from. This is where our dreams and ideas come from. When we meditate or pray, this is the part of ourselves we are seeking. Self is our deepest being.Why does the Ego hate the self? According to Pressfield, its ‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Ä¶because when we seat our consciousness in the Self, we put the ego out of business.‚Äù The Ego hates it when the creator sits down to create, whether it‚Äôs a book, a painting or an exercise routine. Ego hates to lose control, and tries to cripple Self. It hates creators because they are pathfinders to the future.Pressfield ends the book with a simple call to action: listen to your Self and take action in order to find out what you were meant to do. Once you figure it out, do it like a professional. If you don‚Äôt explore and utilize your gifts, you hurt yourself and everyone around you.  If you do, great; you‚Äôre sharing your gifts with the world.Pressfield  uses humor and a confident, competent demeanor in what he shares. He‚Äôs been there and done this, and wants to share the rewarding fruit he has to show for it, to encourage us to seek that fruit for ourselves. He wants us to be able to overcome our enemy, Resistance, and flourish with our own muses.We all encounter Resistance in one form or another (fear of failure, fear of success, procrastination, avoidance, distraction, etc.). This book is an extremely easy read, and was very encouraging to me personally. I would highly recommend it for anyone facing any new project in their life. You will be surprised by the things this book reveals to you, and you will also see yourself represented in more than one situation Pressfield shares. Steven Pressfield defines the enemy, offers a strategy for overcoming it and shows us the beautiful fruit we can have as a result of our labor: A completed work, a job well done. Eventually success. It all started for him when he was finally able to write: The End.

"Mother Night: Myths, Stories and Teachings for Learning to See in the Dark",43.83,4.5,"This collection is beautiful. I love the way Dr. Clarissa narrates, her style, but overall, what she has to share. I know that not everybody is into this wisdom, but if you are, you will not regret buying this CDs. One thing though, I think is better to buy the digital version, CDs are no longer being used. Also, I did not get the full set of CD's which is a complain about the seller (knowing stuff), but not about her work. I really like it.

"The War of Art",43.83,4.5,"Warning: Very long review. This book has helped me multiple times. In The Art of War, Sun Tzu coined the famous phrase ‚Äòknow your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.‚ÄôIn The War of Art, Steven Pressfield launches into a similar discussion. In the first section we will discover our enemy: Resistance. The second section discusses our means for combat: Turning Pro. In the third and final section we will see that the battle is between our Self and our Ego.Resistance ‚Äì Defining the Enemy. This is the first of 3 sections Pressfield shares with us on what he considers to be the enemy of the creator. Resistance is an internal force, the ‚Äòenemy within.‚Äô Defined as self-sabotage, resistance usually manifests as avoidance, procrastination, or inaction caused by fear which creates paralysis. Resistance, according to Pressfield, is invisible, insidious, implacable, internal, impersonal and universal. He elaborates on each of these adjectives (and more), unafraid to use a clever metaphor or simile to illustrate a point. For example, in the section ‚ÄòResistance is infallible, Pressfield writes:‚ÄúLike a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North-meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing.‚ÄùPressfield goes on to point out Resistance in its many guises: the way peers may be recruited as allies of Resistance when an artist starts to conquer Resistance; the people around her ‚Äúbegin acting strange‚Ä¶they are trying to sabotage her‚Äù because they are experiencing Resistance of their own. They may begin to feel guilty for not trying to reach their own potential To make themselves feel better, they pressure her either directly or indirectly to backslide. In my case, I have a couple of people who point out how hard I work, don‚Äôt I need to take some me time? That sort of thing‚Ä¶.Resistance also encourages the artist‚Äôs tendency to quit at 99%, procrastinating work in order to not face completion of their work. Completion opens our work up to our peers for review and examination of others. He states that Resistance has no power of its own, only power it receives from our fear.Any one reading it will be able to identify where Resistance has dug it‚Äôs claws in at one time or another with many of his examples and definitions. I want to point out that nowhere in his book does Pressfield address the Resistance we also face via the internet, email, Facebook, etc. In one section he mentions completely missing Watergate because he was too busy writing. Apparently he is able to focus on his work so strongly these things that distract many of us have no appeal to him.The second section covers: Combating Resistance ‚Äì Turning Pro. According to Pressfield, there‚Äôs no mystery about turning pro. You just make the decision and by an act of your will it is so. By turning pro, Pressfield is talking about the ideal of becoming a professional, a mindset. You make a decision to sit down and do your craft, or exercise, or whatever, NO MATTER WHAT. No matter what tries to distract you and stop you, you keep going until the day is done. You are professional in your dedication and behavior. ‚ÄúAn amateur plays for fun, a professional for keeps.‚Äù The amateur lets a cold or minor distractions stop him. The professional knows he needs to do the work, and then get better. The amateur thinks he can quit anytime it gets tough and go back to something else. The professional doesn‚Äôt want to quit every time he hits a problem, he has discipline and determination to steady him.Turning pro means basically to prepare a work discipline and follow it. To paraphrase Pressfield‚Äôs definition: A pro shows up every day no matter what, stays on the job all day, and is in it for the long haul. For the pro, the stakes are high. Pros accept payment for their work (even if they don‚Äôt always make an income). Pros also master the technique of their work, have a sense of humor about their jobs, and receive real-world praise or blame. He explains the hangovers and colds and other things as excuses we use to deflect ourselves from our purpose and from fulfilling our call. An added benefit, if you really love what you do, you will be like a child who looks up from their activities to be surprised to find that it‚Äôs time for supper.Also, Pressfield makes a point that we are not to get our identity from the thing we are trying to create. You are still you. Your work should be work, not you. Aside from your calling, your life‚Äôs work, you should have an identity that stands alone. If you only have an identity in whatever you are trying to create, you leave yourself vulnerable to the attacks that will come. You will take it all personally and it should never be that way. Your work is what is being attacked, and you should be able to stand back and defend it objectively. Do not over invest your emotional well being in your success or failure. I think this is a common mistake made.You, Inc. ‚Äì Pressman also brings up the benefits of making yourself a corporation. Even if you only think of yourself in this way it can reinforce the idea of professionalism in your work because it separates the artist-doing-the-work from the consciousness-running-the-show. I love his idea of having status meetings with himself. In corporate America, we have a status meeting every Monday morning, decide on a plan of action and who will take care of what part of that plan, then divvy out the assignments, type it up and distribute it to the various participants. He has one of those meetings with himself every Monday. He sits down and goes over his assignments, decides when to be responsible for what, and types it up and distributes it to himself. Sometimes as Joe-blow he is too intimidated to go out and pimp himself, but as Joe-blow Inc, he enjoys the pimping. He‚Äôs not him anymore. He‚Äôs Me, Inc.This third and final section talks about the muses and identifies the cause of Resistance through the Self and the Ego. Muses, angels, demons, geniuses, an input from the collective unconsciousness, all these Pressfield calls our allies, ‚Äúequal and opposite powers‚Ä¶counterpoised against [Resistance].‚Äù These allies join us when we make the shift from being an amateur to a professional.In the second section, he heavily stresses professionalism. He states the most important thing about art is work.

"Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear",43.83,4.5,"‚ÄúAre you considering being a creative person? Too late, you already are one,‚Äù Gilbert asserts. In Big Magic, living a creative life means living a life driven by curiosity over fear and this life is accessible to all who seek it. She breaks down creativity into five essential ingredients: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. Whether readers believe in a magical world or not, her description of ideas, why they choose us, and when and why they leave is inspiring to no end and her roadmap through the twists, turns, and potential pitfalls of creativity are applicable to all who dare to venture on their own creative journey.Gilbert tackles our biggest creative fears and inner demons head-on with delicious humor, wit, and grace. She allows fear a spacious spot in the car on our creative road trip, but never allows it to give us directions and certainly not take the driver‚Äôs seat. Time and again, she effectively and effortlessly silences our inner critic on such universal experiences as: worrying about what others think of us and our creations, bowing to perfectionism instead of completion, evaluating our art as low or high, as brilliant or a disaster, the struggle to declare ourselves worthy of living a creative life, the desire to be fearless or passionate when all we need is courage and curiosity, and much more. She also explores various paradoxes of creativity: the desire for permission and the fact that we never needed it to begin with, that creativity takes persistent hard work on our part and also moments of divine inspiration that come from something else entirely, that no creation is entirely original and yet authentic expressions are always original, and the ultimate paradox: that our creative expression must be the most important thing in the world and it also must not matter at all.Written in easy to digest, bite-size chapters, readers will feel as if they‚Äôre chatting over a glass of wine with their amusing and insightful bestie, Liz, as she masterfully weaves together numerous stories from her personal and professional life with hard-earned creative wisdom, always with an endearing self-awareness that at times borders on self-deprecation, and with a charm that is nearly flirtatious. The lessons are so powerful and relatable that if one were to learn this much about their creative life in a year of therapy, they could consider it a great investment. Big Magic ultimately provides readers with the necessary courage and inspiration to live bigger, happier, and more interesting lives, coaxing out of us our own unique hidden treasures.-- Lisa Blair, MA

"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 2)",43.83,4.8,"I seriously don't even know where to begin with this review because all I want to do is fangirl so hard over how much I ADORED this book! Seriously people...every single word, every single scene is so gorgeously written and breathtaking that I had to stop multiple times while I was reading just to admire and appreciate what I just read. This book was absolutely excellent on so many levels that no words can do it justice (but I'm going to try because this is a review after all haha). I don't think it's any secret that Sarah J. Maas is an amazeballs author, but in case you need a reminder, just read this book and you will see the supreme talent this woman has. She could write a phone book and I would read it because somehow even that would be an amazing read. I've only said this about 1 or 2 other authors, but it's completely true.‚ÄúThere are different kinds of darkness,‚Äù Rhys said. I kept my eyes shut. ‚ÄúThere is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.‚Äù I pictured each. ‚ÄúThere is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.‚ÄùThis book made me feel so many different things at once, and literally it has it ALL! There are amazing twists, snarky banter, beautiful writing, and just plain badass, awesome characters that you want to be best friends with. After finishing this book all I want to do is be in the Night Court and be apart of Rhysand's inner circle. It's probably unhealthy how badly I want this to happen right now. But even more, SJM wrote scenes bursting with heart-pounding action, swoonworthy romance (which be warned, will leaving you squeeing), and female empowerment...GAH! I NEVER wanted to stop reading. But you know what I loved the most? Even though this story is a romance, it is also a story of self-discovery.‚ÄúI was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless againI would not, could not be broken.‚ÄùFeyre goes through so much and is incredibly strong. She is extremely relatable because even though she loses herself for a bit, she finds that inner fire that she once had and it causes a spark to ignite within her. She becomes even more amazing than her character was previously, and finds herself on her own. Feyre is such an admirable and relatable character. I mean who among us hasn't felt lost at one point or the other in their life?? Feyre shows everyone that you have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength to rise above and accept the past, and never let that thing that caused you to be lost define you. We need to embrace the pain and the anguish that came with the hand life has dealt, and choose to move forward in life...or we will remain lost. The character development for Feyre was seriously one of the best character development's I have ever read, and I think SJM deserves a HUGE round of applause for giving all readers this character. She becomes stronger and more determined than ever to accomplish what she has set out to do. All the while she remains the stubborn and sassy character we love.‚ÄúI was not prey any longer, I decided as I eased up to that door.And I was not a mouse.I was a wolf.‚ÄùRhysand...literally I have no words for my love. My heart (and ovaries) were literally bursting with every word he said. He broke my heart multiple times, and there was one scene in particular where I was gross sobbing when he was revealing things to Feyre. He still remains that mysterious Dark Lord, but we are able to understand and see so much more of him than ever before. Like Feyre, Rhys grew so much in this novel, and I loved watching how he became a little less broken due to Feyre's presence in his life. Feyre provides a nice balance to Rhys, and they're banter is like no other. We all know how shameless a flirt Rhys is, but boy does he step it up in this book...and I loved every single second of it. He had me laughing so hard countless times, and I can't even tell you how much I love him.The world that SJM has created is simply phenomenal, and I seriously don't know how she came up with her ideas, but let's just thank whoever that she did. There is so much to this world that we didn't know, and I loved learning so many new things over the course of the book. We visit more courts and see different races. We see the political uneasiness that ultimately exists in this world, and how alliances can change at the drop of a hat. And then comes the ending...it is brutal and ripped my heart out, but it left me begging for more! For the entire conclusion I basically had my jaw permanently dropped and then my heart torn out because of the events that SJM wrote. But all I know is that I can't wait to see where she takes this series in the next book because there are truly endless possibilities!‚ÄúTo the stars who listen‚Äîand the dreams that are answered.‚ÄùIf you couldn't tell already, you need to read this book as soon as possible because this is the best book of 2016 so far!Happy reading :)

"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 3)",43.83,4.8,"‚ÄúWhen you erupt, girl, make sure it is felt across worlds.‚ÄùI seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review. I'm going to try not to include any spoilers, but if there are any, I'll give you fair warning before reading further. Honestly, I am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book. I honestly don't know how SJM can top this book, but let's get real here...she will because she's just that amazing. I read this in one sitting overnight because I simply couldn't put it down. It's true, this book is a Court of Pain and Feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and I felt incomplete after finishing. SJM seriously took her writing to new heights, and I can't even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journey.‚ÄúThe great joy and honour of my life has been to know you. To call you my family. And I am grateful - more than I can possibly say - that I was given this time with you all.‚ÄùI have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because I always felt that it showed Sarah J. Maas' extreme writing talent. It's so different from the Throne of Glass series, and I loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story. You can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her, and every scene is richly described. Her writing truly sweeps you away and it's something that you easily lose yourself in. I know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into Feyre's world, I would not even hesitate. This story is complex and I never expected for SJM to build on the world so much more than previously, but she does, and it's excellent. There is a great progression to the story, and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characters.‚ÄúWhat we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength.‚ÄùThe book starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While some people might have found this part slow, I think it showcased just how far Feyre has come as a character. The strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her (and Rhysand's) plot was utterly fantastic! I think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us Feyre's mindset at the time. I definitely got some Aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass Feyre was, which just added to my love for her character. But the best thing: Feyre's characterization. I thought she was well-developed already, but SJM added yet another layer to her character. Feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book. Looking back, I can't even believe that this is the same person...and that is an excellent thing. It shows how much Rhys and the Night Court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately become.‚ÄúI would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.‚ÄùRhys is as perfect as ever. I mean come on...who doesn't love him?! The way he treats Feyre made me swoon every darn time, and she is his High Lady in every single way. He gives her something that Tamlin never did...respect. He believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing. He allows her to spread her wings (<-- this is an excellent pun btw...I know I'm really not as funny as I think) and embrace her magic. The constant support and love Rhys shows her is something every girl should have. Plus, he's freaking hilarious...you can't get a better man! I honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top 5 book boyfriends. Obviously the chemistry between Feyre and Rhys is off the charts, and all the sex scenes are perfectly written. I love them together so much, it just makes my heart happy.‚ÄúIt's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.‚ÄùCassian and Nesta are brilliant and I firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books. I need them together, and I need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story! They have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book. We learn more about Mor, and my heart broke for her multiple times. I just wanted to give her a giant hug, but I loved delving deeper into her character. Azriel is brooding as ever, but I love him. There is definitely something up with him and Elain, and I need to know what that something is. Amren's sass is pure gold and I love her so much. There are definitely some surprises with her character that left me (along with the characters) shocked. We also meet a new High Lord, Helion and god do I love him! He has to be in these next 3 books because he's awesome. We also see the return of the Bone Carver and the Suriel. And seriously...they play epic roles in the story. And Tamlin...I have to mention this guy. I actually liked how SJM handled him in this book (especially at the end). It was realistic and believable. And (Lord help me), I didn't hate him anymore.‚ÄúMy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.‚ÄùMy favorite part about this book though (besides all the other stuff) is its unpredictability. Seriously, SJM gave me a heart attack multiple times. Just when I thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story. And there was not 1, not 2, but 3 major things at the end in which I was freaking out and making very weird noises that I'm sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate. The one MAJOR (and I mean MAJOR) thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock. I seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life, and I was praying so hard that SJM didn't do what she did. I think I stopped breathing at one point, so HOW DARE YOU SARAH J MAAS!! HOW DARE YOU SCARE ME LIKE THAT!‚ÄúIt is a new world, and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anew.‚ÄùIf you couldn't tell, I LOVED this book! I still am not okay after reading the entire battle since SJM made me lose my mind, but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything I could want. Most of the main questions were answered, but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing. I think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters' perspectives, but I'm never going to mind more Feyre and Rhys. This is by far the best read of 2017, and you need to read it as soon as humanly possible!Happy reading :)

"Circe",43.83,4.6,"This was a very intense story. It read similar to the Illiad or Odyssey but not in verse. I loved this because the author did a wonderful job showing how women were nothing but another commodity for men to use for their pleasure. Gods and men. It felt realistic. The struggle to keep her son safe pulled at my heartstrings since I'm a mother to a very adventurous boy as well. Great story but very slow.

"House of Earth and Blood: Crescent City, Book 1",43.83,4.7,"Being the fan of an author's work is both a blessing and a curse.  You count down the days until their next‚Äîusually hyped up‚Äîrelease is to be published.  You talk about it more and more the closer that said release day approaches.  You try to enter any possible pre-order special is available, in the hope of getting a lovely exclusive pin, or a poster, or a print.And then the book releases...I don't know about you, but once that book hits shelves, I am violently torn between a crazed eagerness to read it, and a nearly crippling fear that I am going to hate the book no matter how much I have loved this author's stories in the past.  Which, let's face it, is one of the worst things to happen in a reader's life.Thank you, Maas, for delivering the goods once again.House of Earth and Blood is not a perfect novel.  I'm not even sure that such a thing is possible, to be frank, because our love of books is a very personal thing.  But, this novel is a punch to the heart, in the best possible way.  I absolutely fell in love with the story, with the characters, with the world that was created.  And it is definitely a complex and intricate world of which we get a glimpse, but that is sure to open up to us even more, and I cannot wait to continue exploring it as the series progresses.I'm a huge fan of badass female leads in novels.  What can I say, I live vicariously through them.  Ironically, I usually don't like so-called ‚Äúbadass‚Äù female leads in novels, because most of the time what we're given are annoying females that try too hard.  I initially read the sample for HoEaB that NetGalley provided, and I was a bit unsure about Bryce.  She came off a tad strong for me, and I was instantly worried that this meant negativity throughout the rest of the novel.  Maybe my mindset was not in its proper place then, but I am so glad that I decided to read the full novel from the first chapter again, because my opinion of Bryce completely changed.I love this woman.Despite the fact that we are reading a fantasy, despite the fact that Bryce is half-Fae, she is very human in her actions and emotions.  She makes her mistakes, she suffers through them, she learns, she picks herself back up, puts on a new pair of teal-colored panties, and she keeps going.  She's believable and realistic in who she is, and it's very easy to become connected to her.This is actually true of the rest of the characters.  They don't always connect right away‚ÄîI was unsure of Hunt at first, of Ruhn, of Jesiba even‚Äîbut once they do, they stick and you root for these people.  You suffer with them, you are excited alongside them, you want them to kick ass and come out winning on the other side.Hunt‚Äîor as I like to think of him in my head, Orion...such a gorgeous name‚Äîhad one of the best evolutions.  I can see that Maas wanted to make him this dark, introverted being at the beginning, and I saw hints of it, but I couldn't quite see him that way full-force.  I think that's one of the things that made me question him for those first few chapters of his appearance in-story.  I see what you want me to see, because you're telling me what to see, but that's not really who he is, and that's coming out more so than the facade he's portraying.  Athie is a deep, tortured, sweet and loving male who slowly opens up to the reader, and he swept me right off my feet.That's probably why the sudden twist at the end of the novel's third part was such a slap to the face, and the biggest problem that I had with this book.We're navigating a story that's centered around the death of Bryce's best friend, Danika, and her pack of shape-shifting wolves‚Äîone of the most heartbreaking moments of the book, by the way, even if the synopsis warns us about it (the writing in this piece, at the start, was wonderfully done and it tore through me).  Eventually, we know that Danika's death, and that of the pack, is surrounded by the use of a drug called synth, which makes people‚Äîboth human and non‚Äîhave strength and violence to such a degree that they can tear others apart.  And the culmination of that is that Hunt is involved in this so that he, and those with him, can use this drug to help themselves be freed from those who have enslaved them.It did not fit with his character.Hunt, who strives to keep others safe, who works and does the horrible things that his handler, Micah, tells him to do so that he can keeps streets safe?  Hunt, who deals in killing demons that come through rifts?  Yes, he has been suffering for over two hundred years, and he has been tortured within an inch of his life, and the love of his life was killed in the midst of this.  But to make him be a buyer, when he comes to know the consequences of the usage of synth, did not fit in with who he is.  As the last part of the novel progressed, things were smoothed out a bit and it sort of fit in.  But this nagged at me so much that I was not able to let it go.I did, as a matter of fact, stop reading for the day once I hit this point, and had to force myself to pick up the book again the next day so that I could continue.It doesn't take away from the story, mind you.  I said it once, and I say it again, I love this book.  I felt every single emotion that was in here, and that's one of the best things that I can ever ask for in a story: make me feel.  And you certainly feel.  You feel to the point of tears sometimes.  Lehabah's end did it for me, that little fire sprite was one of the good ones.  Bryce's phone call to Hunt when she's in the middle of taking out demons after the Gates open and knows she might very well die, did it for me again.  Danika and Bryce's reunion after Bryce makes her Drop did it for me a third time.  And then that bittersweet moment, near the end of the book, when Bryce gets just a glimpse of the pack and Connor waves to her, brought tears to my eyes once again.But I still think that there is, and was, so much to explore.  And while we're taken to the brink of those moments that can be darker, like the ones that Hunt described having experienced during his years with Sandriel alongside Pollux, we're not taken there.  It's not that I want to see my beloved characters suffer, it's that sometimes that suffering can have room for that much more growth.  Sometimes when we bypass that, things appear a little too easy.At the end of the day, though, this was stellar.  My worry was for nothing, and I am going to be suffering until the second book is so much as announced.  I'm still not over the losses in this first installment, I still remember the epic scene of Bryce against Micah, of Hunt's plummet over that helicopter, of Lehabah's sacrifice.  I am so curious to see how the obscure Aidas ties in with this story and what more he has to offer, and I can't even imagine how the Asteri will likely play a part in the future of this world.Bring it on, Crescent City.  I'm waiting.

The author has some good insights, he just doesn't execute the transfer of knowledge well in this book and thus the reader must fend for themselves to really implement what the author is trying to convey and will most likely take many reads/look-backs to fully grasp the fully utility of the message. My biggest gripe with this book, is that there's so much extra fluff and trying to sell you on the method and not enough instruction and application. Forte outlines the four methods to find data in his system, the first two being searching (which is easy enough), browsing (which Forte himself cite a study showing this is the preferred method by humans to sieve data) however due to the simplicity and flatness of his PARA system (as is) true browsing is seemingly impossible and it's not clear as how one should rectify this.  Forte seems to suggest that we shouldn't worry about it, because not everything is going to be useful, but then why bother organizing at all if you can't find an item you need.

"Ailun Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 12 / iPhone 12 Pro 2020 6.1 Inch 3 Pack Case Friendly Tempered Glass",43.83,4.6,"I bought these back in early 2021 and just put on the last of the three today (11/28/22).  It works great on my iPhone 12 and were I to be using a case that wraps completely around the edge, I have no doubts that this would work well with it.  BUT, I'm not using one of those cases because this is for a work phone that sits on a desk all the time, so the case doesn't need to be so tough.The first one lasted almost a year and the second one about five months (the one I just replaced)...never had any problems with the screen scratching or lifting off the phone.  Fingerprints are a minor issue (I just wipe the screen off on my jeans or use some rubbing alcohol on a paper towel) and the glare isn't so bad (or at least, I was never bothered by it).  The previous screen protectors bit the dust after a couple of fumbles, both onto concrete I believe, and cracked with some spider webbing, but there were no angry shards of glass flying everywhere and the rest of the screen held on just fine and operated well until I peeled it off.  The phone screen has been pristine each time, not even a scratch.  Even after peeling it off, it still held together in once piece, and when I tentatively tried to snap it by gently flexing back and forth, it was still pretty solid.I never did crack into the wet wipes, so I don't know if they were any good when I got them.  The most useful parts were the ""dust-absorbers"" aka the sticker tabs.  Those are the BEST to have for this kind of thing.  The little scrap of dust cloth was useful too.  I'll end up transferring my extra stuff to my new box of protectors for next time--no sense getting rid of them when I know I'll need them again!  I don't remember if it came with instructions--this isn't my first rodeo, so I might have tossed them.It was easy to put on and applies like any other protector--you clean the phone really well, check for dust, start peeling the back off the screen protector, and position the top at the top, pull off the backing all the way, and hope for the best.  Mine adhered no problem--in fact, the only problem that I've ever had was when a dust spec snuck in there and messed things up on previous ones.  Sometimes you can go in and lift up the protector and clean that again, but often times you just have to live with it.  You smooth it out a little with your fingers and it should suck down onto the phone on its own; you might have to use a credit card to smooth out any air bubbles, but as long as you cleaned the screen enough, the effort should be minimal.TLDR:  Durable, affordable, comes with helpful applicator stuff.  If you can handle putting on any old screen protector with or without instructions, you'll be able to do this one as well.

This is because you can adjust the speed of movement and choose SITTING MODE. In many games you can ‚Äújump‚Äù to a spot.You will charge your headset and then set up a Metaquest account. After that with your headset on, you will be taken to an interface inside  the VR world where you can adjust and tweak your personal settings to suit you. You will also see APPS which teach you how to use everything.Be aware that if you want to buy Metaquest games only, they WILL download directly onto the headset.  From other sites like STEAM you need to have a computer capable of LINKING the headset to the game. Google the requirements.

However it is a just form of entertainment and after the novelty wears off, like all things in life, after a short while,  it will just become a part of entertainment / relaxation  tools and won‚Äôt replace all your other interests.

And then when the mood suits you you‚Äôll be back on VR.Just so it‚Äôs known, my first experience of VR was a year ago,  in an exhibition, ‚ÄúThe Van Gogh Immersive Experience.‚Äù  The VR there allowed you to travel THROUGH paintings!  I traveled through the beloved ‚ÄúCafe de Nuit‚Äù. I was in.

And THANK YOU üôèI bought the comfort headset, extra attachment, and it‚Äôs worth it to get a good fit. Also if one of your eyes is sharper than the other like mine you can buy lens relacements on Amazon (I believe, I still have to look into it more).

"Working Effectively with Legacy Code",43.83,4.5,"The vast majority of software texts are about greenfield development: creating a new application from nothing at all. But the vast majority of software work involves existing code: adding features, finding bugs, or refactoring code that someone else wrote. This book is a supurb first step in fixing that imbalance.This is not a theoretical work. For example, Feathers does not present a grand ontology of legacy systems. Not is this book heavy on methodology. Instead Feathers describes techniques --- lots of techniques, roughly 50 --- for working with legacy code.The techniques are organized by the problems they address. For example, one chapter is entitled ""My Application Is All API Calls"" and then presents two techniques for working with existing code that is full of calls to APIs.Feathers comes from the XP school, and he adopts that school's premise that you can safely change code if (and only if) there are sufficient tests in place to tell you when your new change has introduced a bug. Many of the techniques in this book are about different ways of putting legacy code into test harnesses, and doing that safely without introducing bugs along the way.He also introduces new concepts, or at least concepts I had never seen before. For example, a ""characterization test"" is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of the code, not what the code is supposed to do, but what it actually does. Why is that useful? First, it is an effective way of documenting what a system actually does, particularly if --- as with most legacy code --- there is no other documentation. And it can tell you when you have changed that existing behavior.Feathers' style is easy to read. As you would expect there is lots of example code here, and it is folded naturally into the explanatory text. My only gripe with the book is with the examples: they are largely in Java, C++, or C. I would have liked some examples in older legacy-only languages, like COBOL.But overall, this book is simply supurb, a tour de force of an important topic that has received little coverage before.

"Agile Estimating and Planning",43.83,4.6,"This Robert C. Martin Series text by Mike Cohn has been unfairly criticized by previous reviewers. The content in general is very well written, and the subject matter flows very well from topic to topic. In my opinion, there is some missing detail that could have served well those readers new to the topic of estimation. In light of this observation, I think that ""Software Estimation - Demystifying the Black Art"" (see my review for that work) can be seen as a companion text to ""Agile Estimating and Planning"". Mike Cohn simply focuses on agile projects, so if such projects are the primary focus of the reader, they might otherwise get caught up with detail that is not necessarily within their domain. From my experience, however, it will serve the agile practitioner well if they understand some of the theory behind the practice of general software project estimation. Of course, Mike Cohn also provides a considerable portion of the book to agile planning in general, and this topic is what makes the book unique in 2007. While other books of this genre can be expected in the near future, the seven parts of the discussion cover the subject matter well: ""The Problem and the Goal"", ""Estimating Size"", ""Planning for Value"", ""Scheduling"", ""Tracking and Communicating"", ""Why Agile Planning Works"", and ""A Case Study"". Each of these parts build upon its predecessors, finally culminating in a case study. I found especially valuable the discussions on agile planning in general, the different methods of agile estimating, how to prioritize deliverables, project schedule iterations, velocity, and tracking. Throughout the text, the author provides dozens of examples with just the right amount of tables and diagrams to aid the discussion. This book is a relatively easy read for a wide audience, and the quotes shared at the beginning of each of the chapters provide a humorous (although usually unintentional), realistic look at the philosophy of estimating and planning by individuals not in the software industry. My favorite quotes of the lot: ""Planning is everything. Plans are nothing.""; ""A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.""; ""In a good shoe, I wear a size six, but a seven feels so good, I buy a size eight.""; ""Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.""; ""There's no sense in being precise when you don't even know what you're talking about.""; ""It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.""; ""To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, but to be certain is to be ridiculous."".

"The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers (Robert C. Martin Series)",43.83,4.6,"As with Clean Code, that other classic also by Robert C. Martin, The Clean Coder is one of these books I wish had fallen in my hands way before they did.There are many other books that teach you how to write good code - that is not the purpose of this book. Rather, Uncle Bob strives to show you how to be a good professional, and all that entails. If the concept makes you want to sneer, don't - there are lots of behaviors that we'd normally do which are not professional and hurt both your company as yourself. Have you ever said ""yes"" when pressed to commit to an unreasonable deadline? Pushed half-done work through? Given overly optimistic estimations that people thought of as deadlines? Felt forced to wade through a mess of (partly) your own making? Well, even if you haven't, odds are that you will at some time, as (sadly) every developer finds themselves at such situations at some point during this career. What this book aims to do is to help you identify these situations, explain why these are harmful and provide you with the tools to better respond to these. Oh, and of course, expect the usual useful insight on how to improve your programming practices.While Clean Code was a bit hard to read sometimes and made you stop every now and then, if only to get a better grasp of the concepts, this one feels so relatable that it reads in a breeze. What more can you ask for?Our craft would be a lot better if every programmer was given a copy of this before they started working. Or at the very least, I am certain that this book has helped me become a better professional and I expect its teachings will continue to do so.

"DOM Scripting: Web Design with JavaScript and the Document Object Model",43.83,4.5,"This is an outstanding book. I has excellent step-by-step examples, and explains things that I‚Äôve never read in other programming books. The examples might seem a little outdated by todays slick JQuery standards, but you‚Äôll know what you‚Äôre doing when you‚Äôre done. It‚Äôs like being able to build your own Volkswagen Bug from scratch instead of going out and buying the latest Hi-Tech vehicle. The first way means you know where all the pieces fit and you‚Äôll understand how everything works.It‚Äôs not for newbies. Read a decent book on beginning JavaScript before you tackle this one. Also, know HTML and CSS. If you do, I guarantee it‚Äôll be worth it.

 ¬ If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell. However for the cost I am very glad I got one. There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module. All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera. This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera. The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung. This is a nice feature. If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app). If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose. For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system. Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell. The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes). If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy. I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it. Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did. Hope this review helped.

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"I've been using the all-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for several months now, and it has truly transformed my viewing experience. This streaming device boasts a fast performance that makes navigating through menus and apps a breeze, although I've noticed occasional slowdowns that require a restart to resolve. Despite this minor hiccup, the device remains highly reliable.The standout feature of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is undoubtedly its exceptional picture quality. Watching movies in 4K HDR, especially Amazon Prime titles, is a visual treat‚Äîthe clarity and color depth bring scenes to life in a way that rivals even high-end smart TVs. The sound quality also impresses, enhancing the overall cinematic experience right in the comfort of my living room.Another significant advantage is its wonderful interface. I must state that its interface is user-friendly, and all the apps I frequently use, such as Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime, Max, and Peacock, run smoothly and load quickly, which is why I find myself preferring the Fire Stick over my smart TV's built-in apps.I would rate the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max 4.5 stars out of 5. It loses half a star due to the occasional need to restart it due to slowdowns, but for its stellar picture quality, robust feature set, and ease of use, it might just as well deserve a full 5 stars. For anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment system without the hassle of cables or satellite, this device is certainly worth considering.

"Amazon Smart Thermostat ‚Äì Save money and energy - Works with Alexa and Ring - C-wire required",43.83,4.1,"I‚Äôve been holding off on buying this thermostat for quite some time based on reviews and even considered other pricier brands for the same reason but I finally decided to give it a try because I‚Äôm sick of having to go over to the thermostat and manually adjust it (first world problem right?)I am so pleased with my decision that immediately after installing it, I bought a second on for upstairs.Installation was easy and took about 15-20 minutes to install and set up in the app.  The unit mounts with 3 screws and anchors, a small screwdriver tool and an optional wall plate. A word of advice - use a better screwdriver because the included tool isn‚Äôt great. You‚Äôll also need a drill with a 3/8‚Äù bit to assist with the wall anchors.Some of the reviews I read mentioned that people had trouble with the app recognizing two thermostats, that was not the case at all with me. It was extremely easy to differentiate in the app and just as easy to control each one.Another review that made me worry about buying this thermostat was that you couldn‚Äôt simply tell your Alexa device to adjust the temperature, and that you had to open the app to make adjustments. This problem must have been resolved or a solitary issue because ours works just fine with voice commands.This thermostat does not offer a sensor option to monitor a particular room or area, so if you‚Äôre looking for that, you may need to look at other options.As far as smart settings, you have two options. Alexa can learn your routines and track your phone‚Äôs location to adjust the temperatures accordingly when you‚Äôre home or away. This works best when everyone in the household connects to the app and consents to tracking. It will even adjust the temperature to your desired settings when you‚Äôre within a certain range of your home.If this option isn‚Äôt for you, it will allow you to set schedules and desired temperature ranges throughout each day of the week. But you‚Äôre still able to log into the app and make adjustments when needed.My last tidbit of information is regarding the second unit that I bought, it was a ‚Äúrenewed unit‚Äù and priced at $40. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect and I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between it and the new one, it came with all new mounting hardware and was just as easy to install as the first one that I bought.

"Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa | Charcoal",43.83,4.7,"This was my first smart speaker purchase.  Initially, I only wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to move between my office and garage.  I didn‚Äôt find anything with decent sound for under $100, so I started looking at smart speakers compatible with Amazon and Google.  Per the many reviews I read, both the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest have good sound, but the Echo has better sound than the Nest.  The Echo also has a 3.5mm jack while the Nest does not, so I chose the Echo.  I wanted that jack as a way to connect my Walkman and listen to my playlists instead of using Bluetooth and draining Walkman battery.My Echo arrived a few days ago and here is my review.  Other smart speaker brands like Sonos, Bose, and Sony were way too expensive for my application and many were not fully compatible with all of the Alexa and Google features.  That was a surprise.  Plus, they were still mono speakers like the Echo and Nest.Amazon immediately sent a link so I could start the setup process before receiving the Echo.  That also gave me time to download and take a good look at the Alexa app on my Android phone.  This initial setup process only took a few minutes.  When the Echo arrived, I read the documentation, then plugged it in and finished the setup process using the app.  There are a lot of possible settings, but many didn‚Äôt apply to me because I am not using any smart devices.  This process also was easy.I plugged my Walkman into the 3.5 mm jack and didn‚Äôt hear any audio.  Later, I figured out that the jack can be configured as an output to another speaker or as an input from devices like my Walkman and the default is as an output.  Problem solved.The buttons on top of the Echo are clearly marked and are raised, so they are easy to identify and operate.  The Echo has some weight to it that makes it stable when placed on my desk or workbench.  It is light enough to make it portable.  The Echo is not considered as a portable device because it must be plugged in, so I added a power supply ($15 on Amazon) in my garage and now I do consider it portable.  The ring at the bottom turns blue when Alexa is connected.  There is a button to turn the microphone off if desired.  The sound is pretty decent; not Hi-Fi but certainly good enough for my purposes and better than the portable Bluetooth speakers I initially looked at.  The Bluetooth connection between the Echo and my Walkman took less than a minute to create.  That‚Äôs great because my Walkman has had issues trying to connect to external speakers in the past.  The Echo also recognized a Bluetooth signal from other devices in my house, but I didn‚Äôt need to connect any of them.I had not planned to use the Echo as a smart device, but found it so easy and convenient that I am using it fairly often for weather forecasts, to find out what channel a game is on, for current news, and other things.  It‚Äôs fun and Alexa answers almost immediately.  Some reviewers complained that they have to repeat requests or speak loudly to get a response from their Echo.  I have not had any issues at all, even with Amazon Music playing and the volume up.The best thing is that Amazon was selling the Echo for half price when I purchased it.  I neglected to choose a color so my order defaulted to blue.  It‚Äôs a soft blue and I like it.  The only thing I don‚Äôt like, and other reviews have commented on this, is that regardless of the Echo color the power supply and cable are white.  They should be same color as the Echo.So far, I am thrilled with my purchase.  Easy to setup, easy to use, responsive, sounds good, portable, and looks good.  I can operate the Echo either directly through the speaker and buttons or through the Alexa app on my phone.  Both work well.  I started with my phone during setup, but now only use the speaker.Update:  Amazon replaced my Echo with a new one.  The hum problem is now resolved.  It is just as responsive and sounds just as good as the original echo that I returned had has no issues.  Now that I have spent some time with the Echo I am glad I chose it over the Google Nest.

"bmani Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones 48hrs Play Back Sport Earphones with LED Display Over-Ear Buds with Earhooks Built-in Mic Headset for Workout Black",43.83,4.4,"Delivery was fast. The buds look nice and the case is nice and sleek.Minor Issues: The case is nice, but the indicators are on the inside. They also don't light up unless plugged in to a power source. It would be more useful if they were on the outside. In addition, the earbuds rest in the case on opposite sides. So the left bud is on the right side, etc. Lastly, there are some issues with the documentation. It mentions and shows how to clean them, but does not include the tool to use or describe what to use. In addition, there are clear typos or translation issues. These could be indicators of a lack of attention to detail and being a cheap product, or it could mean nothing at all. Like I said, VERY minor issues.For the good. I have large ears with very large ear canals. Most buds are either too loose or too tight and cause irritation with prolonged use. When I got these, I immediately put the large cushions on. The buds fit perfectly! The arm is tight, but does not pinch. It rests very comfortably and I feel assured that they won't fall out.The sound quality is good. Not quite great, but certainly good enough. Initial setup was easy and took less than a minute.Combine this with their low cost and we have a true winner.They claim a life time guarantee, so we will see how that goes, but registering the product was super easy! It was probably the easiest registration I have done.Overall I am very very happy with this purchase. I will also be checking out any other products that they offer. I fully recommend these for anyone in the market for a low cost set of Bluetooth earbuds.

"The Best in Beauty Delivered Monthly",43.83,4.2,"I‚Äôve enjoyed each Allure box that I‚Äôve purchased. The items that I‚Äôve received are definitely well worth what I paid for the box. It‚Äôs nice to be able to try higher end products without having to pay the full retail price. Plus it‚Äôs a lot more convenient (in my opinion) to buy it on Amazon as opposed to buying it directly from Allure. There‚Äôs not a big hassle if you want to cancel like there is when you buy directly from Allure- which is a HUGE plus for me.

"Amazon Basics Full-strip Metal Office Desktop Stapler, 20 Sheet Capacity, 3 Pack, Black",43.83,4.6,"The stapler that I am reviewing is a basic, no-frills model that can be found in many office supply stores. It is made of sturdy plastic and metal, and it feels solid in the hand. The stapler is easy to use, with a simple design that allows you to staple papers together quickly and efficiently.One of the things I appreciate about this stapler is that it can handle a decent number of pages at once. I've stapled together up to 20 pages without any issues, and I imagine it could handle a few more if needed. The staples themselves are also easy to load, with a small compartment that you can open and close with a snap.In terms of performance, this stapler gets the job done. It staples cleanly and neatly, with no jams or misfires. The staples hold together well, and I've never had any issues with papers coming apart after being stapled together.Overall, I think this is a great stapler for anyone who needs a basic, reliable tool for everyday use. It's not fancy or flashy, but it does its job well and it won't break the bank. If you're looking for a stapler that can handle everyday tasks without any fuss, this is a great choice.

"Amazon Basics Organization and Storage Outdoor 99 gallon Deck Box, Brown",43.83,4.5,"Wish I could give this box 5 stars. It's a decent box that assembles easily and seems like it's design was done by a structural engineer and not just a plastic mold machine worker.The hinge is definitely not the weak link and the lid only attaches  to them when it's out of it's normal range that  the straps restrict.The lid sits in the closed position fairly well. What would have gotten this box 5 stars is if the bottom of the box was double wall like the rest. It's definitely a weak point. As long as it's not used for heavy objects or slid around it should be okay but it's not up to par with the rest of the box. As the sections slide together really easily, it could use some caulk or sealant in a few places to assure that they stay in place. It's not perfect but it's not something that you will break forcing together or sending right back after unboxing because you can tell it's going to have a short life span.Edit; I see that another review states that the box leak water in while opening. It does but if you open it slowly, justs a few drops come in.

I like the handy streaming channel buttons on the bottom, and the voice recognition works really well. I love that the FireStick is easy to use and install. The remote is good quality because we‚Äôve dropped it plenty of times and it still functions perfectly. The customer service is also great on it if you ever have any problems, and there are plenty of answers online if you ever have questions.

"Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 Release) in Charcoal bundle with TP-Link Kasa Smart Color Bulb",43.83,4.7,"I've had earlier versions of the Echo Show/Dot, etc  it was time for an upgrade, the last one had taken a beating.  I was arguing with it constantly and somehow fragrance wax had been spilled all over it and as dastardly as it appeared, it was still kicking.  However one arguement too many and played a hard game of basketball with it and it was time to get another one.  When the combo sale popped up in the Black Friday festivities (Nov 2023) I took full advantage.  Once the product arrived, which in stride with Amazon's standards arrived the very next day, and I was eager to install.  Of course I immediately handed to my assistant to install, he did a phenominal job, said it was very easy.  He even got the light to work right away.l  I love the idea that I can adjust the light to any color I desire on the spectrum and as bright as I like.  If they made it in a grow light it would be even more amazing, I'm kinda wondering if it has that capabilities with the range of colors, but that's another day I reckon.  Light works with voice command very easily.  I'd ask Alexa for some suggestions or you will be standing there yelling commands over and over to no one in particular, cuz she won't be listening.  But once Alexa so generously gave me a suggestion, I was off and running.  My favorite setting is low enough to employ as a nighht light, so that is exactly what i do with it.  As far as the Alexa, i do like the new shape and the sound is great.  She does seem tempermental sometimes.  We do still argue. (We're considering counseling) About the only difference I am not really a fan of is the volume buttons.  On the dots, you only had to touch the command button and on the latest version you do have to push the command button down.  It takes longer to adjust the volume and I feel like I'm mashing the device, but it hasn't.  Other than that no complaints.

"Homall Gaming Chair, Office Chair High Back Computer Chair Leather Desk Chair Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)",43.83,4.4,"I got this chair with a new desk, get the whole ""gaming"" experience. The chair doesn't really work well with the desk's proportions, but that has nothing bad to do with the chair. I am going to list off the problems I have discovered with this chair that I've had now for more than 6 months.‚Ä¢ The actual seat, and the way it feels is completely fine, but where your butt and lower back are located, there is little to no airflow. Meaning you'll sweat, you'll sweat a LOT.‚Ä¢ The lumbar support takes a while for you to find where you should line it up on your back, also it's rough the first couple of days, it takes a while to soften the cushion up. But after that, it's a nice way to feel like your keeping your back and posture healthy.‚Ä¢ The neck rest's default position is horrible you have to stretch the band across the entire back of the chair to put it in a good position, and also for gaming and general computer usage using a headrest is not gonna be something you use at all, you will probably use it when watching something and just relaxing but apart from that you won't use it.‚Ä¢ Elbow/Armrests are fine but for extreme long use 8 hours+ your elbows will start hurting but wearing long sleeves or some elbow sleeve will fix the problem.‚Ä¢ The parts of the chair, where it has extra fabric, or extra chair I don't know what to call it put the parts where the chair extends is useless, it just takes up space.‚Ä¢ The pentagon of legs on the bottom of the chair is your Achilles enemy, I have hit the back of my foot on the feet of this chair on accident, and GOD does it hurt, the pointy angles are not a help.Now onto the things, I found good or great about the chair:‚Ä¢ The retractable seat is amazing. After playing for a couple of hours you can lean back and pop your back it's the best feeling in the world, it's amazing to relax in this chair.‚Ä¢ The piston and anything spring-wise have been holding up perfectly and I haven't run into any problems at all so far!‚Ä¢ The headrest, while not being used much is still very comfy and great for the times that you do relax and lean back.I may not have pointed out many good things about this chair, but I honestly believe if you want to try it out go ahead, it's not perfect for its price but I wouldn't really say it's overpriced. It's something you are going to probably sit in every day and if you want something to enjoy sitting in and want to look cool in this chair is fine. If you want a chair that you can use for the rest of your life with no problems, there are chairs out there just with a larger price range.

"BestOffice High-Back Gaming Chair PC Office Chair Computer Racing Chair PU Desk Task Chair Ergonomic Executive Swivel Rolling Chair with Lumbar Support for Back Pain Women, Men,White",43.83,4.4,"I'm a big believer in ""you get what you pay for"" and I usually advise to save up, make one purchase, make one investment and don't worry about it for a few years. But something about this chair's value really scales, especially if you can grab it on sale. I got mine in white for $75 including tax and shipping. Many quality gaming chairs cost hundreds of dollars. There a handful of cheap office chairs you can snag for $60. This chair compared to one of those generic office chair is worth the extra $15. If you're looking at this chair for $90 or higher, then the former statement is true (save up). Anyway. I've had this chair for a day now and it isn't perfect. I'll go over what I like and what I don't like.Appearance: It looks nice. Doesn't look or feel too cheap. The base is metal with plastic feet. Many chairs have plastic base with plastic feet.+1ptFunctionality: This chair has a handful of features--You can adjust the height. +1ptBut it only has about a 3in range -1ptIt has a lock to let you remain upright and can be unlocked so you can recline back. +1ptIt does NOT have a way to lock in the reclined position. -1ptComfort: This chair is pretty comfy. It has a removable/adjustable head pillow and a removable/adjustable lumbar pillow as well. +1ptIt is a little stiff. Some people may like that. It also may break it after a while. I've only had it one day so I will update if something new develops. The chair has a *mostly* comfortable width to me. It measures 19"" for arm to arm. But it has this little ""cushion"" that tries to contour your legs that makes it a little uncomfortable to sit with my legs spread even a little. I have to keep my knees closer together than I normally would to keep the ""cushion"" from digging into the side of my legs. Because of this, there is really only about 16"" of room for your butt or the sides of your thighs. I'm about 5'10"" Male 215lbs size 38 pants XL shirt. I think I am at the cusp of being able to comfortably sit in this. It was not made with larger people in mind. It does state a 250lb weight limit while we're on the topic. -1ptAssembly: I've assembled several office chairs before and this process was similar and just as easy. +1ptIf you aren't experienced or if you struggle with Ikea stuff, you may find it difficult. The hardware that they include is kinda junk. If you have the luxury of using your own hardware (or hand tools at least), I would highly recommend it. I had one bolt that had really junky threads from the factory and I couldn't do much about it, just had to cross thread it and tighten it the best I could. I had another bolt that stripped and the thread never would grab. Luckily there was one extra included in the packaging and I ended up being able to tighten it without cross threading. I think I got lucky. 90% of the assembly was smooth sailing and the few snags that arose, I knew exactly what to do. Again, if you aren't experienced with this, it could easily turn into a headache and a return to amazon over poor quality hardware

"GTPLAYER Gaming Chair, Computer Chair with Footrest and Lumbar Support, Height Adjustable Game Chair with 360¬∞-Swivel Seat and Headrest and for Office or Gaming (Faux Leather, Red)",43.83,4.4,"I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could‚Äôve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It‚Äôs incredibly easy/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it‚Äôs simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It‚Äôs very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that‚Äôs likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn‚Äôt feel wobbly or like it‚Äôs going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It‚Äôs not exactly top of the market quality but that‚Äôs to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget. Exceeded expectation. 8/10

"Gaming Chair, Ergonomic PC Chair, Home Office Chair with footrest, Racing Computer Chair Reclining Game Chair for Adults, 330lbs Heavy Duty, Leath-Aire Fabric (Black2)",43.83,4,"I have own mine for a year now, and I am thinking about buying a different one.

And for those who may wonder, I am 5'7"" 180 lbs. So, for the acclaimed max of 300 lbs, this chair is not worth it, it is in the cheaper side of actual reputable brands, but a $160 is still a pretty penny.Comfort, not it's weakest point. Being able to lean parallel to the floor is quite nice, but a little stiff.

Thank you Allure!I really love my Allure box! I appreciate the higher end selections and always find products that I love! I‚Äôm not looking for trendy products though, I‚Äôm really looking for the classics and higher end items. I  feel like sometimes it‚Äôs easy to look at the number of items in a box instead of the quality and size of the items. Fillers are a waste in my opinion; I‚Äôd cancel a subscription who tried to stretch the number of items in the box with inexpensive items before I would a subscription that brings me higher end items. In my opinion, my only hesitation with this box is that I‚Äôve seen subscribers complain that certain items are made in China and not of the same quality and price point as the ones marketed and sold from Europe...... I don‚Äôt know if this is true. If the  items are not the same, than I would not think Allure would be able to market those products with the higher value attached as that would be obviously misleading, again just my opinion. I really hope that that isn‚Äôt true. I‚Äôd like to hear Allure speak to that, in fact the future success of this box may depend on it as it seems to drawing unfavorable attention on reviews.

"Asurion Complete Protect: One plan covers all eligible past and future purchases on Amazon",43.83,3.3,"This is probably my second or third time around availing myself of this service. The last time I have used it was to service a DVD/ video recorder, which was new when purchased. Unbeknownst to me the machine while great at what it does ( I have many priceless DVD transfers) the video part of it does have a shelf life. Meaning that after many hours ( maybe months) a part(s) simply were out! Of course I did not know this at the time of purchase. Luckily I had purchased a Asurion plan which I think cover the machine repair for 3 years. When I contacted them about a problem they did not hesitate to have me send it to them and even walked me through the process.The machine was fixed three times. This after many, many hours of use. Every time they gladly fixed the machine and sent it back in working condition. Now I‚Äôm sure that the parts were hard to find and expensive for the VCR as well as having someone knowledgeable enough to fix it. On the third(4) time I had a problem they e-mailed me to say that they would have to check with the supervisor about repairing it.It was still under warranty with if I remember correctly less than a half a year left. Instead of stonewalling me as so many other companies like to do, they got back to me within a couple of days and said that they could not repair the machine, but would refund the cost of the VCR/DVD combo which was over $1000.This is why when I just purchase an expensive $300.  Badly needed air purifier with a somewhat sketchy track record, I didn‚Äôt think twice on purchasing a Asurion protection plan. It is they who helped me make the decision to buy from Amazon ( I live in an urban area where I can shop in person at Target, Walmart etc).And it was Asurion past history that made the difference.If I have not done so in the past let me say THANK YOU ASURION, THANK YOU AMAZON

"NEO CHAIR Office Chair Computer Desk Chair Gaming - Ergonomic High Back Cushion Lumbar Support with Wheels Comfortable Ivory Leather Racing Seat Adjustable Swivel Rolling Home Executive",43.83,4.2,"Needed an office desk chair to work from home in. Since I would be working 8 plus hours a day, I wanted a comfortable chair. I also wanted a chair that was sturdy and had a metal wheelbase. This chair was one of the few in the range I wanted to work within that has a metal wheelbase. It‚Äôs an attractive piece. Also, the weigh capacity for this chair is approximately 300 lbs. I‚Äôm around 225 lbs, which was another reason, I went with this chair, I wanted something I knew would support my weight. I just finished assembling the chair and have only sat in it for a few minutes. Here is my early review. I would have given a higher rating if it weren‚Äôt for some minor blemishes in the appearance I spotted immediately out of the box. First, the paint had several scratch marks on one of the arms. There was a dark mark on the bottom seat cushion that did not easily rub off with a spit rub. I‚Äôm not sure if it is a mark or tiny tear, but I decided not to mess with it too much and potentially make it worse. The other arm of the chair, which the arms are made of a hard plastic (for some reason not metal), had a gouge in it and was split about a half of an inch or so. Probably damaged in shipping, though package looked undamaged. As far as the assembly of the chair, I did not find it very difficult. I completely assembled in approximately 20 minutes by myself. Assembly tip: Screw in screws prior to assembling arms and back cushion. Some of the material from the cushions slightly cover holes. Also, do not tighten screws before arms and back cushion are all attached. I would advise to lifting arms up (if laying cushion on its side, so screws go all the way down into the holes straight. Tighten screws while lifting up on the arms to ensure they go in straight. If you have put together a desk, bookcase or chair before, you should not have a problem with this chair. My final point of this review is in regards to the comfort of this chair. Again, I have only sat in it for a few minutes and I will update this review later if it becomes necessary. However, as of this writing, I am fairly pleased with the comfort of this chair. It also feels pretty darn sturdy! At my size, it doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed and appears to be able to support someone much larger. While sitting, there‚Äôs at least 3 to 4 inches of room on both sides of me. I do not feel restricted at all. Furthermore, with the back of the chair in locked position, in my opinion, there is very good support. Nothing feels uncomfortable. My only being picky issue would be the cushioning on the arm rests could be thicker and softer; but it‚Äôs nothing major. Quite frankly, this chair feels better than my office chair where I work (which I‚Äôm sure is a more expensive chair). In conclusion, in an early review, I‚Äôd like to give a glowing report, but the minor blemishes immediately out the box, annoyed me pretty quickly. However, the relatively easy assembly, combined with the sturdiness and comfort allows me to recommend this product at this time.

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"The short answer is this is a very good device, and I would recommend it. So why 4 stars? Well, I am basing this on the 1st GEN of the Show 5 and just Alexia issues in general. I will list the cons first and then get to the positive. The 1st GEN and 2nd GEN are basically the same almost no difference from what I understand.- My overall biggest issue and this is all Alexia devices, she just does not listen. Basically she is temperamental! She thinks you say something other than what you said or just makes suggestions for no reason. When you ask her to stop it is not fast at all. AMAZON FIX THIS!!!!!!! This is sort of like a partner or friend that is upset and will not stop talking. Yes, you know what I am talking about‚Ä¶.lol- The software OR firmware needs to be updated or improved. Amazon absolutely needs to have a enable or disable all for all the screen options. For example, most people turn off nearly all the options in the Home and Clock area; there are a ton, and you need to do one-by-one.- When making changes, there is a delay. Took nearly 3 or 4 min for the clock interface to change. Should be immediate and then if I don't like to allow me to go back. Instead, I make a change and I thought was broken because nothing happens; tried 5 times After a few min it finally switched.- Improved, however, there is still a big delay the touch screen.- Amazon really needs give you the options to have her stop telling asking you if you want to buy amazon music if you ask to listen to a particular artist. It will play it but first tells asks if you want to buy music for X $ a month.THE POSITIVES:+ The Sound is greatly improved except for her voice itself. If listening to music, you 100% do get better sound from the previous version. Main reason I got it.+ The screen size is the same, but the body is a smaller footprint.+ It is no longer rectangular, but more of a curved design so just looks nicer.+ As I mentioned earlier, the touch screen is better but still not great. However, it is a little faster and not worse so I guess a win.Overall it boils down to this‚Ä¶.. if you have a 1st or 2nd gen and you are happy with the audio then skip it not necessary. However, if you want better sound for music then I say it‚Äôs worth it. If you do not have any Show device the 5 is a nice choice especially if using on a nightstand.

"Asurion Complete Protect: One plan covers all eligible past and future purchases on Amazon",43.83,3.3,"This is probably my second or third time around availing myself of this service. The last time I have used it was to service a DVD/ video recorder, which was new when purchased. Unbeknownst to me the machine while great at what it does ( I have many priceless DVD transfers) the video part of it does have a shelf life. Meaning that after many hours ( maybe months) a part(s) simply were out! Of course I did not know this at the time of purchase. Luckily I had purchased a Asurion plan which I think cover the machine repair for 3 years. When I contacted them about a problem they did not hesitate to have me send it to them and even walked me through the process.The machine was fixed three times. This after many, many hours of use. Every time they gladly fixed the machine and sent it back in working condition. Now I‚Äôm sure that the parts were hard to find and expensive for the VCR as well as having someone knowledgeable enough to fix it. On the third(4) time I had a problem they e-mailed me to say that they would have to check with the supervisor about repairing it.It was still under warranty with if I remember correctly less than a half a year left. Instead of stonewalling me as so many other companies like to do, they got back to me within a couple of days and said that they could not repair the machine, but would refund the cost of the VCR/DVD combo which was over $1000.This is why when I just purchase an expensive $300.  Badly needed air purifier with a somewhat sketchy track record, I didn‚Äôt think twice on purchasing a Asurion protection plan. It is they who helped me make the decision to buy from Amazon ( I live in an urban area where I can shop in person at Target, Walmart etc).And it was Asurion past history that made the difference.If I have not done so in the past let me say THANK YOU ASURION, THANK YOU AMAZON

"NEO CHAIR High Back Mesh Chair Adjustable Height and Ergonomic Design Home Office Computer Desk Chair Executive Lumbar Support Padded Flip-up Armrest Swivel Chair (Beige)",43.83,4.2,"Suffering from scoliosis, it's difficult to find a chair that fully supports my curved back.  When I saw this, I thought I'd give it a try, but I was hesitant.  And I wasn't disappointed with the back support. However, there are a few drawbacks:1) The first three wheels were easy to install; the fourth a little difficult and the fifth was an absolute bear.  Husband had to take a heat gun and heat the post and then push it in.2)  Per the enclosed diagram, the lever to raise and lower the chair is inaccurate.  In order to raise the seat, you need to push down on the lever, then stand up slightly.3)  Installing the bolts can be tricky so do exactly what the directions say:  Leave them loose until just about everything is installed.  This way, you can make any adjustments easier.  You might need a second person to help; I managed to do this on my own but I could have had another person helping.4)  Yes, the chair back comes in a gray color, no matter what color you order (I ordered beige).Positive comments:The instruction booklet is well laid out with clear diagrams.  I got a chuckle out of the reference to not get your hand caught when installing the fifth leg; it created a personal touch.The language is easy to understand.Would I buy another?  Sure!

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"Actually the temporary cloud you get when you first turn it on is not bad. The ongoing fees if you want to keep it are above average. You can DIY it by using a synch module - which you really have to have anyway, a usb power block, a usb cord and a usb drive. All of this clips into a cheesy holder and the whole thing plugs into a socket. Elegant design it is not. It occupies about 6 inches high by 4 wide and 4 deep of wall space. A strong cockroach can knock it out of the socket. But, it does store your clips  at home and you can pull the drive and send it to whatever cloud you have via laptop or desktop. The video bell is easy to install with 2 screws. Setup is just shoot a pic of the QR, and give it a name. It will not make any notification inside! Buy ( are you getting the idea blink is a kluge ? ) one from many retailers or use Alexa ( guess what kids you must buy this too) , for which there is a skill and multiple chime sounds. [ or hardwire to your old school doorbell chime I may do this when it stops snowing. Wait, I live in FL, no snow, I am never going to do this]. The picture is fine although 1k rather than the latest  2k.  If you wait a bit you can see it on your phone, though I find Alexa faster. There was supposed to be a one button push for iphone and android notification so you do not have to unlock phone, start app and click on view. I have not found it yet. Batteries. Yes you need them and they are why I bought this ( already having a blink setup). My old doorbell non blink cams use 18650 which need charging every 3 months or so and die between 2-3 years & require the most expensive $20 a pair 18650s. And I was not about to install doorbell transformer, wire and chimes which allow running on 12-26 volts AC but this is an option. My other blinks have run since 2021 without the bother of recharge on AA lithiums as does this. The AAs cost $20 a pair. I am happy. The voice com for you and visitor is clear, nightime view ok, you will recognize your Mom. Motion detection works well. Hey Amazon, Alexa, Blink we all know you are the same corp. - make the synch module a neat desktop saucer shape thing with cord and plug or even cord and power block. That wall wart thing is nasty. Guess what ? You can even add micro usb storage. Guess what what? Put the $%*& thing inside next gen echo view). One star off because Prime delivery guy would not install it. ( actually guys thanks for walking up that 2 story ramp to house every time I buy something).Update: Customer service. Wanted to have doorbell image come up automatically on bell push. Found a couple of u tubes on how to implement but due to poor eysight and worse hearing could not implement. Tried cust support. Asked me to allow them access to setup to help arrange. Did so, then got new rep telling me  She, was taking over. Well 17 emails back and forth it  ( it had to have been an IT bot calling itself Jen, paid no attention to anything I said) blew me off saying it could not be done but what a great idea would let the IT guys know. Right. See google for proof it can be done. Zero for you Jen and blink cust svc. Update: blink vust service emailed again and asked for third time what I wanted. Repeated whole thing and refered them to 3 videos showing what they said could not be done, could be done. They responded by sending me links on how to set up alexa. As I have bern using alexa for 3 years this was of course useless, as apparently is blink support.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"Okay,  1 year using and 1 year to learn so as to give a real review,  it's not some 4k ultimate video recording doorbell,  but the video is clear enough and dollar for dollar it might be one of the better 1080 doorbells,  it does have some issues I found work arounds for and some I couldn't,  the reviews you read saying it's very slow to motion alert you are not just hard to please customers,  it is an issue,  It is slow to alert you thru the app on your phone,  why I have not a clue,  the work around is if you have Echo Dot or Echo Show and you know how to set up routines,  have Alexa tell you when that device detects motion,  I found it lightning quick,  why that works faster I don't know,  lol, remember I'm doing honest review on how things worked for me.  I also discovered you can have Echo Show or Echo Dot be your chime so again if you understand Alexa routines,  and you have alexa devices,  you will never have an issue hearing when someone rings your blink Doorbell,  don't forget to link your Blink app and the Alexa app to ensure the above things work for you,  okay on to issue I can't find a work around,  Blinks idea of battery life reminds me of auto manufacturers MPG  estimates,  we all know in the real world it's not going to happen,  sure,  if you dial down all the features,  you might get half of what Blink says,  but then I ask you,  why have it,  we buy them to use them right  ?, so I have found average battery life even using the suggested energizer ultimate lithium,  is about 6 months,  not 2 years  and don't care how they or their paid reviewers try to spin it,  it's not going to happen even if you dial all the features down,  making it a waste of money,  and yes I'm using the sync module which is supposed to help battery life,  maybe it does,  can't answer that but real life,  no B.S. spinning,  your not going to come close to their battery projections,  my only work around for that is the batteries are easy to change and I understand and can deal with this,  Speaking of the Blink module,  I use it for local storage and I also use the pay for cloud storage,  that's another non work around issue,  far far to many features are LOCKED OUT,  if you don't pay for the Blink subscription,  Now if you don't care about saving videos and you just want to know who is at your door regardless if you are home or away,  this will alert you,  it will display to you video of who and allow you to talk to them also and I must say it does a good job at it and you don't need the blink subscription and if you do have the Blink module and a usb stick in, it will save those for you,  at short lengths,  but it will do it.  Overall it is a good security device,  and although obviously it is far from the better ones.  From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this,  , easy to install,  no wires,  pretty much can put it where you want it,  Again it does everything pretty well,  One of the best prices out there,  just understand it has shortcomings,  but also understand it's price,  and it will certainly do the job for you,  this isn't a trashing review,  I  tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it,  it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others,  but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another,  remember,  you can put them about anywhere,  I actually have one stashed at the front of my house,  not by the door,  it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away,  sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not,  weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them,  including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain,  snow and cold,  it has held up well,  still ticking,  no signs of wear,  so another plus

"Authentic Japanese Snack Box Subscription - Japanese Candy Mystery Box, Monthly Candy Box Containing Various Japanese Snacks: Classic Box",43.83,4.5,"I wanted to give my kids something interesting since we are all stuck at home during lockdown, so I decided to spring for a snack box subscription. I chose Japanese snacks because I can't eat gluten and on occasion, they have rice-based snacks so even I can join in the fun sometimes. Through a series of bizarre circumstances I accidentally ordered a ""Tokyo Treat"" brand box AND this Bokksu in the same month, and it was too late to cancel when I found out. I can say that this box is absolutely better. I has full descriptions, interesting information, allergen info, and a really nice selection. It says they are premium quality and they really are -- this isn't gas station crap, it's delicious. The kids love it, and I like it, too. As far as value for money, it's a little pricey but it's coming from Japan, and in my box everything arrived whole and in good condition. I like that it comes with tea, too.The short version is that this is definitely better than Tokyo Treat, and it's cheaper, and it's a really nice and interesting thing that kids enjoy and so do I. Not really the best budgeting choice, but I justify it to myself because I'm only buying gas for the car once a month now.

"Like-new Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa | Twilight Blue",43.83,4.6,"First off, you can buy two refurbished for a bit more than one new one. $120 vs $100. They sound killer. Get the sub. You‚Äôre gonna be happy. I suggest this model with the sub-they‚Äôre designed to match. The crossover between the Echo and the sub is seamless. Perfectly matched. No adjustment needed. The Alexa app is really well planned out. Plug the Echoes in, combine them to stereo, pick a room. Done. There‚Äôs been a ton of complaints about teo things. Random disconnects‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre like me, you might have 5 or 6 wifi devices in your room, with a wall or two between you and your router. It‚Äôs not a problem with the Echo-your router probably can‚Äôt handle the load. Check with your ISP for a newer model. With most of my gear on all over the place, even my ridiculously priced laptop runs at maybe half speed or less.  Got a better router that could support 50 devices at once, problem solved. These run over wifi. I‚Äôve only had a dropped connection problem once since i got them in February. Keep two of them a decent distance between, the seperation is amazing. ( side note-i don‚Äôt care what anybody tells you-don‚Äôt stick the sub behind something and right next to a wall. At least a foot away from a wall, and out in the open. The difference is really noticeable. I won‚Äôt bore you with details, look online. It absolutely needs that space)Yes, a lot of reviews say the Sonus sub is better. It‚Äôs also $750 USD. It‚Äôd better be an improvement. Get real. The issue with the Sonus is the variable crossover, so it‚Äôll work with any speakers. But unless you‚Äôre a genius with a frequency meter, the Sonus sounds muddy, creeps up into the sat speaker range, basically killing off the low end. I only say this  because i owned a setup. My decades old Pioneers sounded better. $1200 wasted. Returnef them. The big sellimg point?  The Echo setup only goes down to 35hz. The Sonus goes down to 28hz. Makes zero difference. Nada. Not enough to justify the massive price difference. For what it‚Äôs worth, the subs in my main revording room go down to 18hz. At half the price, and are way more accurate. Anyway.Grab these while you can. Yes, the ball shape is ‚Äúugly‚Äù??? It‚Äôs round. The design is much better acoustically than the tall tubes. Way better. Are they gonna fill a good sized tv room? Not really, just not enough power, but in a smaller room, they‚Äôre perfect.Sorry about the long read. I‚Äôm a live ‚Äúsoundman‚Äù, been since‚Äô93. I have a good ear-i have to. It‚Äôs my income. Over more expensive setups, this is near the top of my list.Buy and enjoy!!

"Amazon Reload",43.83,4.7,"This is a good way to always have an Amazon Gift Card Balance ready for anything you may need or want at Amazon. You determine the amount you want to apply to the account and it will be ready for you within a short period.  If you like, you may want to add a certain amount each month, day, or week. When you set it to auto-reload your balance on a schedule, be careful how you set it up. Example: Don't set it up on a day of the month and move the box to the next day or you will automatically add the amount you want to add in the current month and not the next month when you want it to start. I did this and was surprised to find out what happened. So, load up your account with your pre-determined amount each period of time to keep your Amazon Gift Card Balance ready for anything.

"Marvel Design Vault Club T-Shirt Subscription - Men - Large",43.83,4.3,"I bought this subscription for my husband as a gift and have been pleased after 2 months so far. The designs are unique - you won‚Äôt see them elsewhere. The tees themselves are roomy; the XL is on the generous side which is nice. The fabric is soft and comfortable, not stiff, and it breathes well. They seem to wash up nicely and haven‚Äôt shrunk noticeably after being tossed in the dryer on low. So far we have had a black tee and a spring green tee so they seem to vary the colors a bit. I would recommend this subscription based on the above.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"Okay,  1 year using and 1 year to learn so as to give a real review,  it's not some 4k ultimate video recording doorbell,  but the video is clear enough and dollar for dollar it might be one of the better 1080 doorbells,  it does have some issues I found work arounds for and some I couldn't,  the reviews you read saying it's very slow to motion alert you are not just hard to please customers,  it is an issue,  It is slow to alert you thru the app on your phone,  why I have not a clue,  the work around is if you have Echo Dot or Echo Show and you know how to set up routines,  have Alexa tell you when that device detects motion,  I found it lightning quick,  why that works faster I don't know,  lol, remember I'm doing honest review on how things worked for me.  I also discovered you can have Echo Show or Echo Dot be your chime so again if you understand Alexa routines,  and you have alexa devices,  you will never have an issue hearing when someone rings your blink Doorbell,  don't forget to link your Blink app and the Alexa app to ensure the above things work for you,  okay on to issue I can't find a work around,  Blinks idea of battery life reminds me of auto manufacturers MPG  estimates,  we all know in the real world it's not going to happen,  sure,  if you dial down all the features,  you might get half of what Blink says,  but then I ask you,  why have it,  we buy them to use them right  ?, so I have found average battery life even using the suggested energizer ultimate lithium,  is about 6 months,  not 2 years  and don't care how they or their paid reviewers try to spin it,  it's not going to happen even if you dial all the features down,  making it a waste of money,  and yes I'm using the sync module which is supposed to help battery life,  maybe it does,  can't answer that but real life,  no B.S. spinning,  your not going to come close to their battery projections,  my only work around for that is the batteries are easy to change and I understand and can deal with this,  Speaking of the Blink module,  I use it for local storage and I also use the pay for cloud storage,  that's another non work around issue,  far far to many features are LOCKED OUT,  if you don't pay for the Blink subscription,  Now if you don't care about saving videos and you just want to know who is at your door regardless if you are home or away,  this will alert you,  it will display to you video of who and allow you to talk to them also and I must say it does a good job at it and you don't need the blink subscription and if you do have the Blink module and a usb stick in, it will save those for you,  at short lengths,  but it will do it.  Overall it is a good security device,  and although obviously it is far from the better ones.  From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this,  , easy to install,  no wires,  pretty much can put it where you want it,  Again it does everything pretty well,  One of the best prices out there,  just understand it has shortcomings,  but also understand it's price,  and it will certainly do the job for you,  this isn't a trashing review,  I  tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it,  it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others,  but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another,  remember,  you can put them about anywhere,  I actually have one stashed at the front of my house,  not by the door,  it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away,  sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not,  weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them,  including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain,  snow and cold,  it has held up well,  still ticking,  no signs of wear,  so another plus

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device, more than 1.5 million movies and TV episodes, supports Wi-Fi 6, watch free & live TV",43.83,4.7,"Got it for a spare tv not used much and I could not put my cable app on it. Samsung did not have the app in their App Store.  I was paying extra for a box and remote. Decided to get this when price dropped. Because my WiFi is basically Amazon product it just took over and did everything itself when I plugged it in. Wish there was a paper with a diagram of the remote . But realized while practicing with it there is an area that shows everything on their tv program.  Perfect app. Lot like my bigger Sony tv which has chrome and Amazon.  That tv had the app.Anyhow other than not realizing where search area on tv to hit to get the search keyboard, everything came out fine. Found my cable provider to download and it works fast. Have all my  paid apps and free apps. Amazon even provides a live tv. But mostly fix stuff.  No cnn or nbc or cbs stations..  still rather keep a cable like network. It‚Äôs easier to use. The app for fioptics works fine exactly like my TiVo co box. Can‚Äôt save on it. I did not see a record button. But have that on my other tv with TiVo boxes. Everything is on WiFi and streaming. Even TiVo streams. There is no numbers on the remote of the firestick. There might be a better remote you add with numbers, but it does have peacock, Netflix and Amazon prime and one other dedicated buttons.  I like Amazon digital products. They are excellent and I am an Apple person for the phones and computers. But Amazon really makes it easy to set up among its products. By the way, Samsung tv‚Äôs in 2017 did not allow fioptics app on their tvs. Sony and LG does have the app in their App Store. Must be something between two companies. Samsung had Apple  but not Amazon.  Would be nice if they got along!, it just might be the Altafiber fiber optics company. But the product is good. Once it new I had Amazon account, it just completely downloaded and updated everything.

I loved that we got a credit for the trade-in when we bought another one. There are a lot more buttons than the previous remote, and more things you can do with it. I like the handy streaming channel buttons on the bottom, and the voice recognition works really well. I love that the FireStick is easy to use and install. The remote is good quality because we‚Äôve dropped it plenty of times and it still functions perfectly. The customer service is also great on it if you ever have any problems, and there are plenty of answers online if you ever have questions.

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"I purchased this Alexa enabled Echo Show for my remote office. I find great utility in the three other Echo Show devices already deployed throughout my home as well as the multiple Alexa enabled echo devices sharing both private and common areas in my home as well as my automobile.Alexa is always happy to handle the routine tasks associated with the day to day operations of a modern smart home.The interface to a variety of complimentary systems from multiple Amazon partners makes Alexa enabled devices like the Echo Show 3 an indispensable part of the modern connected family.I routinely introduce my friends and colleagues to my Alexa enabled FireTVs (all six of them), one 1st generation Echo, a 2nd generation Echo with a battery unit providing portability throughout my garden, 7 (yes, 7) Echo Dots beginning at the first edition and continuing to the most current version and I‚Äôm planning even more.Fidelity with such small speakers is great and a nice surprise from an unexpected place. The display is a little small but it‚Äôs very sharp and it‚Äôs color representation is great.Personally I love the video call feature because it helps keep me in touch with my friends around the world. Of course I had to get them Alexa enabled Echo Shows, too.Heck, I even gifted and installed 6 other Echo Dots along with a single Echo Show to one of our local nonprofits. I added automation to the buildings HVAC systems through Google Nest controls integrated with Alexa and I have plans to automate even more.To say I‚Äôm a fan of all of my Alexa-enabled products is an understatement.If your creative, the developers kit makes writing your own routines a breeze. Imagine an infinitely configurable group of smart home devices making your life easier. I know, I did it.  I think everyone should make this technological leap too.It‚Äôs not AI enabled but it‚Äôs Natural Language Processing capabilities make all of my Alexa enabled products shine!If you don‚Äôt yet have one or two or twenty-something Alexa enabled devices in your home or office you are missing out! Trust me, I don‚Äôt want to go back to any time of my life without Alexa. That says it all.

"Chapin 20000 Made in USA 1 -Gallon Lawn and Garden Pump Pressured Sprayer, for Spraying Plants, Garden Watering, Weeds and Pests, Polypropylene, Translucent White",43.83,4.5,"The sprayer works well and is easy to assemble. Once assembled, it is also easy to operate. You pump air into it with the handle on top and can spry ca ‚Öì of a gallon before you have to pump again. The sprayer can be adjusted to a fine mist, or to a constant streaming, which is for example good, if you want to get insecticide into the crevices in the concrete on your driveway.What I did not appreciate is that the manual shows you a lot of add-ons as if they were part of your delivery. They seem to be in the ""What's in the box"" section, so my first impulse when I opened the box was to send it back to Amazon because a lot of stuff seemed to be missing. Only on a second look did I realize that the items displayed were extras that you can order should you need them. Also in other sections the manual is unnecessarily complicated. What you need to know to assemble, fill and operate the sprayer can easliy be said on one page, instead you get like a booklet with all unnecessary details in it, which is confuding.

"Authentic Japanese Snack Box Subscription - Japanese Candy Mystery Box, Monthly Candy Box Containing Various Japanese Snacks: Classic Box",43.83,4.5,"I wanted to give my kids something interesting since we are all stuck at home during lockdown, so I decided to spring for a snack box subscription. I chose Japanese snacks because I can't eat gluten and on occasion, they have rice-based snacks so even I can join in the fun sometimes. Through a series of bizarre circumstances I accidentally ordered a ""Tokyo Treat"" brand box AND this Bokksu in the same month, and it was too late to cancel when I found out. I can say that this box is absolutely better. I has full descriptions, interesting information, allergen info, and a really nice selection. It says they are premium quality and they really are -- this isn't gas station crap, it's delicious. The kids love it, and I like it, too. As far as value for money, it's a little pricey but it's coming from Japan, and in my box everything arrived whole and in good condition. I like that it comes with tea, too.The short version is that this is definitely better than Tokyo Treat, and it's cheaper, and it's a really nice and interesting thing that kids enjoy and so do I. Not really the best budgeting choice, but I justify it to myself because I'm only buying gas for the car once a month now.

I have also connected it to my smart TV to use it for the sound and that is an experience as well!  Better than any ""stand-alone"" sound bar I have ever heard!  The voice recognition is the best of any echo device as well. It has 7 mics and is able to hear my commands even when the music is at a higher volume.  Tip:  Be sure to experiment placement and see where it sounds best from where you will be listening to it the most. The Echo Studio is so good, I wish I could afford another one!!!

The device is nearly invisible plugged into the back of my TV. Have not delved into the Alexa voice control yet. So, initial impression after 2 days is very positive. Easy to set up and great on line resources to solve problems.  Very satisfied so far and hope my Fire Stick keeps working well.

"All-new Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet, built for relaxation, 10.1"" vibrant Full HD screen, octa-core processor, 3 GB RAM, latest model (2023 release), 32 GB, Black",43.83,4.5,"I have a herd of Kindle Fire Tablets from over the years.  I think I buy at least one new one every 2 years, if not yearly.  The price is right, especially during Prime Day or Black Friday sales, so why not?  The ""old"" ones then become upgrades for my parent's tablets -- or they get used as a touch-screen interface to a music system or home automation system, or they upgrade the *really* old ones that eventually become too slow or are no longer supported.  I have a few tablets I designate for use when I'm outside grilling or partying and don't mind getting beat up a bit.These 10in tablets are a nice size for when you want a bigger screen.  We've used them on Zoom calls with relatives and it's nice not having to listen to the noise of a laptop fan spinning up and down while video conferencing.  I've used them with some cloud gaming services and once again, it's awesome not having to hear a fan like you usually would when playing games on a laptop or PC.  I've also used these tablets to connect remotely to my desktop.  Paired with a bluetooth mouse and keyboard you can essentially use the tablet as a ""thin client"" to connect to a more powerful PC and the battery lasts a lot longer than a normal laptop battery would.  I've used some drawing applications on them too, where even if you just use your finger and pinch-zoom to magnify, you can actually create some pretty nice drawings if you're artistic.The world of apps and usefulness of Kindle tablets really opens up if you side-load Google Play Store.  I like Tinycam for viewing wireless pet cameras, SuperDisplay and EasyCanvas for a lag free display for Windows, Squeezer for remote control of Squeezebox music system, Pinball Arcade for pretty authentic pinball experience, Microsoft Remote Desktop to connect to Windows desktops, NoMachine to connect to Mac Mini lag free, Steam Link & a bluetooth Xbox controller to remote play games from my desktop, Touch Portal (powerful remote macro control deck like Steam Deck), Sketchbook for intuitive drawing, Squid for note taking and brainstorming ideas, SimpleMind for quick mind maps, Engross for todo lists, Habits for easy habit tracking, MyRadar for viewing live weather radar & the list goes on!  Again, only after installing Play Store do you open up that world of possibilities, otherwise you are limited to what's on the Amazon App Store.  If you're a bit technical it's not hard to figure out.My wife and I love our Kindle Tablets and this 10in tablet is was the newest member of the group.  We've had very few issues with any of the tablets we've bought over the years, aside from some of the normal things that happen after you've installed dozens and dozens of apps and at some point have to wipe the tablet to clear it out and speed it up.  But no hardware issues to speak of really.  They've just ""worked"" and have been pretty rock-solid.  Unless they become more expensive, or quality changes, we'll continue buying Kindle tablets in the future.

Those dual 1.7-inch speakers deliver audio so crisp, it's like having a front-row seat to the coolest show in town. Alexa plays their favorite tune, and suddenly, the room transforms into a private VIP lounge for the whole family.But the real showstopper? Video calls! The high-res camera turns video chats into virtual hangouts that are almost as good as having grandma in the room. Skype, and Zoom ‚Äì they're all here to make family connections stronger than ever. It's like the Echo Show 5 is the high-tech bridge connecting generations.And for family multitasking? Alexa's got it covered. Smart device control, daily news updates, weather forecasts, recipe suggestions ‚Äì it's like having your concierge who also knows how to tell a good joke. Seriously, ask Alexa for a joke; the kids love it.Setting up the Echo Show 5 was smoother than a bedtime story. Even for those of us who consider ourselves tech-challenged, it's a breeze. The interface? Kid-friendly and intuitive, making it a win for the whole family.In conclusion, the Echo Show 5 isn't just a smart display; it's an all-in-one family entertainer and organizer. It's the smart investment that turns your home into a party zone for the kids, a communication hub for the family, and a tech-savvy sidekick for the parents.

"House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, 1)",43.83,4.7,"Spoiler Free Part:I'm going to start off by saying that I am a moderate SJM fan. I tried but failed to ever get into her Throne of Glass series (particularly thrown off by the multiple love interest changes) and really only got truly into ACoTR series towards the end of the first book. While I liked her writing style, I just couldn't connect with the characters. The last third of ACoTR was the first time I felt like the characters were interesting and the plot became engaging. So, I say this without rose colored glasses- I liked House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City Book 1). I thought it was well written, interesting and I connected with the characters. My biggest love of the book was the deep and real feeling of unquestioning love between the two best friends, Bryce and Danika. It's not a spoiler to say that Danika is murdered, as its in the book blurb, but I had totally forgotten and was absolutely gutted when it happened. Bryce's grief for her friend felt so real throughout the books. I think that was what made me empathize with and like her beyond her sassiness. Also, I for one didnt mind the partying and drug use specifically because its depicted that she realized she was basically wasted her life chasing stupid pleasures and not doing anything meaningful. However, this book has a TON of info dump and exposition. I'll go into it more below in the spoiler section, but there is a LOT of information for the reader to process constantly, and new characters are introduced constantly as well making it feel like there are just too many cast to keep track of. The relationship between Hunt & Bryce feels organic to me and I didn't feel that it was ""insta-love"" as some others have complained. It made sense to me that they were the only two people who saw each other as they really were. My biggest gripe is that the very last bit of the book feels like it was supposed to be part of one of her other series compared to the rest of the story.Overall I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars, it was far from perfect but it was highly enjoyable and I'm anticipating the next book in the series.********SPOILERS**********DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!I really loved the relationship between Bryce and her friends throughout the book. They felt very real and genuine. Even the relationship with Rhun felt nicely done. The friend characters were well fleshed out and didnt feel too two dimensional.I really like the world building. I think the caste system and the way the Vanir reign is well explained and makes sense. I thought the concept of ""The Drop"" was unique and interesting.And of course, I loved Danika. Oh boy did I love Danika, and I was heartbroken when she died, because I had forgotten it was coming. When Lele died, I was also genuinely saddened. I felt like the emotions in the book were really well done. Although some people complained about the multiple dead-end leads, I enjoyed them (at one point I was certain Sabine was the killer) because it would have been really boring if they just easily figured it out right away. The Kristillos demon was kind of a disappointment. I mean, it took down Micah but really didn't seem that dangerous overall.I liked Aidas and am intrigued to see him return in future books.I also liked the war between Humans & Vanir. That was something that ACoTR hinted at being a possibility but I think the concept of rebelling against their masters and finding a way to fight back was a good plotline; however I also think Bryce doesn't seem to care too much about their cause. She is always befriending and trying to free slaves, her parents are humans, but she doesn't seem to care all that much about the overall subjugation of multiple species. It kind of gets treated like ""thats the way it is"" without any sense of outrage or hatred about it.Alright now for some gripes:Fury is just a carbon copy of Amren. What is the point of her whole character? Bryce could have been partying with June that night; Rhun could have put a gun to Hunts head and rode Bryce off on the wave runner; Rhun also could have been the one with a helicopter stashed off site. What did Fury actually do for the plot?Everyone is soooooooooooo super crazy off the charts perfectly hot, and also, everyone is insanely deadly. Now I get it, they are Vanir and Angels, but come on. Is there no such thing as an ugly werewolf or an unattractive mermaid? And everyone is a super honed amazing assassin. Fury, Bryce's adopted dad, Rhun and his friends, Hunt, every werewolf, etc. Everyone is stunningly hot and dangerous. To us, they might be, but if that was your entire world your entire life wouldnt it seem a little trite? If everyone is hot, does it mean anything anymore?Also like others have said, jesus with the overkill about Bryce being scorch-the-earth-hot. I get it if Conner & Hunt are super attracted to her, and if she gets hit on occasionally. But it is literally like every male she meets throughout the book can't bear to keep their hands off her. Every time she walks down the street every male is just falling all over themselves to look at her. It definitely feels slathered on a little thick.One of the biggest things that bugs me though is this: The last third of the book. Oh my god. Everything happening on screen, Micah going all Bond Villain and giving a long monologue explaining everything he did and why and just happened to be on camera for everyone important to see. Eye roll. We weren't even with Bryce during most of the action but rather watching it alongside the other secondary characters. The whole scene with the Nok was absolutely unnecessary and just felt like it was dragging out the ending of the book. Micah could have slammed Bryce into the tank, resulting in it cracking and her being severely injured, and Lele still could have broken the glass without the whole Syrinx-Rescue/Nok-Fight even needing to happen. In fact, it would have felt more believable that the Nok fought Micah and occupied him long enough for Bryce to escape than for Micah, the Archangel, the immensely powerful Governor, to have been....conveniently locked in a magically warded bathroom while a whole other scene got played out. It just felt totally unnecessary.Okay- now- last major gripe:THE LAST 50 PAGES OF THE BOOK. What the hell? Did we suddenly get transported into A Court of Thorn and Roses? Portals to Hel opening up all over the city, the lead character running around fighting in hand-to hand combat to protect helpless citizens, the magical companions fighting demons with her.......it felt like I was suddenly watching Feyre, not Bryce. On top of that, while I appreciate the symbolism of Bryce using Danika's sword, it felt totally unrealistic to see a woman who spent the last five years of her life first partying and being a college student then an antiquities desk clerk suddenly is an amazing sword wielding killer. The gun thing is believable due to her Stepfather and the scene at the gun range. But we never once see Bryce mention ever knowing how to use a sword or pick one up, but suddenly she's single handedly taking on an army of demons with flawless sword fighting? I really enjoyed the ending bit with her making the Drop and Danika being there (so touching) but other than that the very last part of the book suddenly felt like it was just a rehashing of the battle scene from A Court of Mist & Fury.The ending of the book wrapped everything up pretty well, but it also leaves a lot unanswered. Bryce admits that the entire city saw her use her Starborn powers and that she is now more powerful than any other mixed-species has ever been before. She even says the Fae & Angels can't let it stand that she showed their caste system was invalid. And yet, the highest Angels told her just to lay low and they would leave them alone. Obviously, we know that they probably don't, but I feel like a cliffhanger as to what would happen now in the fate of humans Vs Vanir/Angels and what that revelation was going to mean for Bryce would have worked better than just wrapping it up in a neat but not really logical bow.I still liked the books, I still like the characters and I am excited for the next one, but hopefully some of these issues will be corrected going forwards.Anyway that concludes my long as heck summary, thanks for reading!!!

"The Teacher",43.83,4.3,"This book!  Oh my lord THIS book lol..... Let me start out by saying I am a huge Frieda McFadden fan and have read a lot of her books and already have upcoming releases of more of her books pre-ordered because she is just THAT good!  This book is engaging from page one and keeps you turning the pages.  Without giving any spoilers, all I can say is you will think many times ""Oh I know whats going on, I have got this figured out"" only to then go ""um....I was wrong then but NOW I have it figured out"" over and over again.  The last chapter bring all of the twists and turns into a solid focus (and it will keep twisting and turning until that chapter, which I LOVE)  However, she throws a MASSIVE MASSIVE BLINDSIDING CURVEBALL at you that you will never see coming too lol (Do yourself a favor and DONT read ahead just because you saw this review, Dont ruin it for yourself! I promise its soooooo worth the wait!)  I finished it and told my coworker about it and she borrowed it and LOVED it too, but came in to work the day after she finished it going ""what the F#@$, I did NOT see that ending coming, that came out of NOWHERE""  I said ""I KNOWWWWWWWWWW"" hahahaha

"Excalibur",43.83,4.7,"Even with the innumerable tours through the mind of Derfel, 'that Saxon dog,' there was much action, blood, guts and gore to fill the most bloodthirsty of us.Not much soft emotions of the type you'd see in Lady Chatterly's or Bajillion Shades of Grey...but enough to see just who had soft spots and not all hard carapace.Very well balanced.

"Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear",43.83,4.5,"The ideas of this book are, of course, nothing new. But as Elizabeth actually puts it, it's her take on living a creative and joyful life. I've read similar ideas from other authors, with different backgrounds, all with their own spins, and I find this one very refreshing. It might seem at times that it's only focused on the creative ""arts"", but this applies to everything.I bought both the Kindle book and the audio since Iike alternating between them. However, the fact that it is narrated by Elizabeth herself made the whole thing much, much better!If anything, this books is a great reminder to not take things so seriously. Enjoy what you do. Stay active. Don't stop making things. Don't let inertia rob you of the precious time we have in this Earth. If you decide to read it, do so with an open mind, and use it to analyze yourself. I don't think anyone cares if you think

"Circe",43.83,4.6,"My experience with Greek mythology was first instilled by the movies of Ray Harryhausen. I loved Jason and the Argonauts as a kid and still do to this day. I may have read some condensed little bits of Greek myth while in middle school. It was not until I attended college that I was exposed to Ovid's Metamorphosis. And although I found Homer interesting, overall I thought The Odyssey was pretty dry. Maybe it was just the translation I read.Madeline Miller's new novel, Circe is in no way dry or boring. It takes the old myths that we are familiar with and weaves them together into a narrative that is captivating, engaging, and fresh. Reading Circe is akin to sitting is a great hall after a meal while a poet recites tales of love, passion, loss and magic. The lights are dim and a crackling fire is burning on the hearth.Circe is the daughter of Helios, Titan god of the sun. A seemingly black sheep of the family she is exiled after showing kindness to Prometheus who was punished by Zeus for bringing fire to mortals. It is here that Circe's story begins to take off. She is exiled to the island of Aiaia. On this island she hones her craft of herbcraft, referred to as pharmaka. To the gods it is considered witchcraft.But even in exile she receives visitors. The first is Hermes, the messenger of the gods. He doesn't care about her exile status and finds her fascinating. He brings her news of the outside world, of the wars of man and the petty squabbles between the gods.We later get glimpses of Circe's family. Her sister is Pasipha√´, wife if King Minos of Crete, and mother of the Minotaur. Her brother is Ae√´tes, King of Colchis and keeper of the Golden Fleece. Through her eyes we get a unique perspective on the old myths that so many of us grew up on.Circe is probably best remembered as the witch that Odysseus encounters and basically shacks up with for a year while returning from the Trojan Wars. And true to the spirit of the this narrative, Miller presents presents a different perspective on the familiar tale as told by Homer.Madeline Miller has managed to take the old and present it as something that is fresh, and told in a style that is engaging and hard to put down. The language flows smoothly and is almost conversational in ton. It's perfect for the first person perspective that it is written in. Of special note, the audiobook, as narrated by Perdita Weeks, is exceptionally performed with nuanced storyteller like performance. It is Perdita Weeks' first book narration and I hope to here more of her performances.One of the underlying themes of the novel is the perception of women in the world of the Greek myths. Miller explores that not only with Circe, but with Medea and Penelope as well who had been given short shift in most other interpretations. Jason and Odysseus are not the heroes that they have often been portrayed as and the reason why Circe changes any men that come to her island to pigs is understandable and as far as I'm concerned better than some deserved.What Miller has done is something special and hopefully can be taught alongside Homer and Ovid in Classics courses in the future. Despite it being a retelling of stories thousands of years  old, its style is modern, and relevant. Highly Recommended.

"House of Earth and Blood: Crescent City, Book 1",43.83,4.7,"Spoiler Free Part:I'm going to start off by saying that I am a moderate SJM fan. I tried but failed to ever get into her Throne of Glass series (particularly thrown off by the multiple love interest changes) and really only got truly into ACoTR series towards the end of the first book. While I liked her writing style, I just couldn't connect with the characters. The last third of ACoTR was the first time I felt like the characters were interesting and the plot became engaging. So, I say this without rose colored glasses- I liked House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City Book 1). I thought it was well written, interesting and I connected with the characters. My biggest love of the book was the deep and real feeling of unquestioning love between the two best friends, Bryce and Danika. It's not a spoiler to say that Danika is murdered, as its in the book blurb, but I had totally forgotten and was absolutely gutted when it happened. Bryce's grief for her friend felt so real throughout the books. I think that was what made me empathize with and like her beyond her sassiness. Also, I for one didnt mind the partying and drug use specifically because its depicted that she realized she was basically wasted her life chasing stupid pleasures and not doing anything meaningful. However, this book has a TON of info dump and exposition. I'll go into it more below in the spoiler section, but there is a LOT of information for the reader to process constantly, and new characters are introduced constantly as well making it feel like there are just too many cast to keep track of. The relationship between Hunt & Bryce feels organic to me and I didn't feel that it was ""insta-love"" as some others have complained. It made sense to me that they were the only two people who saw each other as they really were. My biggest gripe is that the very last bit of the book feels like it was supposed to be part of one of her other series compared to the rest of the story.Overall I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars, it was far from perfect but it was highly enjoyable and I'm anticipating the next book in the series.********SPOILERS**********DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!I really loved the relationship between Bryce and her friends throughout the book. They felt very real and genuine. Even the relationship with Rhun felt nicely done. The friend characters were well fleshed out and didnt feel too two dimensional.I really like the world building. I think the caste system and the way the Vanir reign is well explained and makes sense. I thought the concept of ""The Drop"" was unique and interesting.And of course, I loved Danika. Oh boy did I love Danika, and I was heartbroken when she died, because I had forgotten it was coming. When Lele died, I was also genuinely saddened. I felt like the emotions in the book were really well done. Although some people complained about the multiple dead-end leads, I enjoyed them (at one point I was certain Sabine was the killer) because it would have been really boring if they just easily figured it out right away. The Kristillos demon was kind of a disappointment. I mean, it took down Micah but really didn't seem that dangerous overall.I liked Aidas and am intrigued to see him return in future books.I also liked the war between Humans & Vanir. That was something that ACoTR hinted at being a possibility but I think the concept of rebelling against their masters and finding a way to fight back was a good plotline; however I also think Bryce doesn't seem to care too much about their cause. She is always befriending and trying to free slaves, her parents are humans, but she doesn't seem to care all that much about the overall subjugation of multiple species. It kind of gets treated like ""thats the way it is"" without any sense of outrage or hatred about it.Alright now for some gripes:Fury is just a carbon copy of Amren. What is the point of her whole character? Bryce could have been partying with June that night; Rhun could have put a gun to Hunts head and rode Bryce off on the wave runner; Rhun also could have been the one with a helicopter stashed off site. What did Fury actually do for the plot?Everyone is soooooooooooo super crazy off the charts perfectly hot, and also, everyone is insanely deadly. Now I get it, they are Vanir and Angels, but come on. Is there no such thing as an ugly werewolf or an unattractive mermaid? And everyone is a super honed amazing assassin. Fury, Bryce's adopted dad, Rhun and his friends, Hunt, every werewolf, etc. Everyone is stunningly hot and dangerous.

I (like most people) disliked Nesta from the beginning, but this book is so beautifully written, it made me love Nesta with my whole heart despite her shortcomings. SJM makes this character so relatable while also making the whole story unpredictable and addicting! The extra spice (compared to the other books in the series) is an added, and very-welcomed, bonus! This was most definitely my favorite in the series- love her or hate her, Nesta makes one hell of a great story!!

"The Creative Act: A Way of Being",43.83,4.7,"You know, those books that you read that you want to buy in bulk and gift to everyone you have ever met - and keep on hand for everyone you will ever meet?This is THAT book for me.I can‚Äôt even explain it‚Äôs magic or compare it to anything else I‚Äôve ever read. It is by no means a religious book. I would not really classify it as self-help either. It stands alone - unless there is a genre for books that live, breathe, and have a soul. If you have ever wanted to read the Bible (or other holy text) but struggle with the language to get to the underlying message, this could be an alternate option. Thoughtfully and patiently crafted. Simple, sweet, impactful, magical, relatable‚Ä¶just so beautiful in every way.***update*** - after reading several of the less than 5-star reviews I decided to add this since it appears the expectation laid out in the Preface may have been missed by some who cannot seem to appreciate the refreshing simplicity and implied purpose of this text as communicated in the Preface - see photo for Preface screenshot.It FEELS as if this book was intentionally designed to reach as many human minds as possible. This human experience causes us to attach to multiple identities throughout this life - some more permanent than others. I have considered what it might have been like to have this book through every phase of my life so far. When I reflect on all the beliefs that have been rooted, recycled, or replaced, I think I would have cherished this book the most through every major period of growth. Now at age 50, I am regularly challenging my beliefs and biases and I turn to this book frequently for inspiration to that affect. To achieve a work that is easily digestible to every identify and phase of life‚Ä¶that in and of itself must be a daunting task to undertake these days so BRAVO!!!IF you are expecting a book chock full of the authors‚Äô legendary work, this is not that book. Though some of the ideas reference the authors‚Äô experiences with other well-knows, the examples selected are brief and (I feel) carefully curated to support ideas as an example to serve as further clarity and reach every level of comprehension.IF you are looking for a step by step guide on how to‚Ä¶whatever you are into, also NOT that book (see Preface)IF you are looking for a scientific, intellectual, complicated, book full of new ideas to debate with your bourgeoisie friends to see whose most woke (yes I said it)‚Ä¶look elsewhere.BUT‚Ä¶. If you are looking for what seems to be a plea from one human beings‚Äô humble heart to the rest of humanity‚Ä¶THIS is THAT book!

"A Court of Thorns and Roses eBook Bundle: A 5 Book Bundle",43.83,4.8,"So, product review first. Pretty dang good. I came across like 1 to 3 pages or something that were printed lighter than the other pages, but not all that noticeable. I tend to notice super duper tiny details and flaws. Another thing, on 1 page there was like something on the page that I couldn't get off. I dunno what it was, and it wasn't that big, but it did kinda bug me because I wanted these books to be PERFECT. BUT the products good, shipping was pretty okay, like 4 or some days to get here, felt super long because I ordered them with a feeling that I like needed to reread them or I was going to die sort of thing. But yeah. Just buy em. I kinda am regretting not getting hardcovers, but like, I'm cheap and I barely got myself to pay for the paperbacks.STORY REVIEW! Read them. They aren't super spicy, to me at least. A court of silver flames is definitely one of the spicier ones. The spice doesn't take you away from the story or distracts you. Acotar may be a bit slow at first, but stick with it. Please, you'll thank me later. It's just, it's indescribable. It's a good story, I love it, and I recommend it. Just read them. Also, the bat boys, OH MAH GAWD. I love them all. I couldn't decided which one I love more, they are all so fricken cute and hot and amazing in their own ways. But yeah, I recommend!!!!!

I love my echo dots but this is great for the kitchen when using recipes or etc. I bought another one from Target for my room, but I like this white front and soft blue back look much better than the boring black ones from Target. To be fair, the Target price was very good. Similar or a couple dollars less than whatever I paid for this one. I bought them both right before Christmas 2023.

"COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare",43.83,4.6,"First things first I absolutely appreciate the fact that this product came with the seal on the outside of the box which made me feel secure that I was getting a brand new product! The pumps come already in the bottle of these products which is why the seal being on the box is a big indicator for me ( stating this to say that this is the authentic product it just comes with the pump already in the bottle for those who are iffy. To be sure, you should have to pump the pump a few times before product comes out, if product comes out on first pump with any product, it's been used. I know this from working in beauty stores). Upon applying the product to my skin OMG!!! it's so moisturizing!! instantly firmed and smoothed my skin and gave it this beautiful glow! I like the little retinol that came with it as well. I will give an update of photos of my skin in a few weeks to show the progress of the products. The second pic is of the power essence after being used a few days which should let you know these bottles come filled to the top ensuring you get your money's worth!! I will definitely be ordering again as I'm already loving the feel of this product and highly recommend!!

"Ailun Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 12 / iPhone 12 Pro 2020 6.1 Inch 3 Pack Case Friendly Tempered Glass",43.83,4.6,"I recently purchased the Ailun Glass Screen Protector for my beloved iPhone 12 Mini, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This screen protector has proven to be an exceptional addition to my device, providing top-notch protection without compromising the touch sensitivity or clarity of the screen.First and foremost, installation was an absolute breeze. The package came with detailed instructions and all the necessary tools for a seamless application. Within minutes, I had the screen protector perfectly aligned and adhered to my phone's screen. Ailun's installation process is user-friendly, and even for someone like me who has never applied a screen protector before, it was a stress-free experience.One of the standout features of this screen protector is its remarkable durability. I've accidentally dropped my phone a couple of times since applying the protector, and each time, I was relieved to see that my screen remained completely intact and scratch-free. The tempered glass is incredibly tough and has effectively shielded my device from everyday hazards such as keys, coins, and minor impacts.The clarity of the Ailun Glass Screen Protector is exceptional. It preserves the original vibrant colors of the iPhone 12 Mini's display, and I can hardly tell that a protector is even present. The oleophobic coating works wonders in keeping fingerprints and smudges at bay, making it a breeze to wipe away any marks that do appear. The touch sensitivity is flawless, with no noticeable lag or interference, ensuring that I can navigate my phone as smoothly as before.Furthermore, the screen protector is precisely cut to fit the iPhone 12 Mini's screen, covering the entire display area without obstructing the front camera or sensors. It provides edge-to-edge protection, giving me peace of mind knowing that every corner of my phone is shielded against potential accidents.Ailun's customer service also deserves a special mention. I had a minor issue during the installation process, and their responsive and helpful team promptly addressed my concerns, going above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. Their commitment to customer support is truly commendable.In conclusion, the Ailun Glass Screen Protector for the iPhone 12 Mini is an outstanding product that delivers on its promises. It offers excellent protection, crystal-clear visibility, seamless touch response, and a hassle-free installation experience.

"Quest 2 ‚Äî Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset ‚Äî 128 GB",43.83,4.7,"Since I got it properly adjusted the headset is comfortable and provides an amazing VR experience. It is completely immersive with fantastic sound quality (not hi fidelity, but music sounds good). My wife walks right by me while I‚Äôm playing and I have no idea she‚Äôs there.It can be a little disorienting at times, so it‚Äôs important to have plenty of open space around you. I haven‚Äôt tried it sitting down, but that might be a good idea when playing games with more motion/ movement to avoid getting motion sickness.I‚Äôve only tried a couple different games but the selection appears to be pretty good. Edit: Beat Saber and Moss are two must-haves. Incredible experience in both. PistolWhip is also quite fun.The one knock would be the short battery life (I haven‚Äôt run it all the way down, but would estimate it at 1-1.5 hours). However, they recommend taking breaks and not playing for too long at any given time. The battery life works in a one-user scenario, but would be too short if you‚Äôre sharing the headset between multiple users. Edit: After playing on the headset more I‚Äôm finding the battery is lasting longer than I originally thought. After two solid hours of play today I still had a good chunk of battery left. Increased my rating to 5 stars based on this.Overall, I‚Äôm very happy I bought this headset.

"The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers (Robert C. Martin Series)",43.83,4.6,"A colleague of mine recommended this book and its predecessor (Clean Code). I have not read Clean Code yet but decided to read this one first. This is a good book on professional code of conduct for those graduating out of university and venturing into professional arena - to these folks this book gives pretty good advice or at least provides a pretty good starting point. For those who already spent several years in the industry such as myself, a lot of what he has to say would be obvious - in that case one's own professional experience would have taught most if not all of what the author advises on. For instance consider the quote from chapter 2 - ""Professionals have the courage to say no to their managers"". I learnt this lesson (the hard way) in my career. Now it would have been better if I had learnt it sooner from other people's experiences. That said, I do believe that there is a limit to how much you can learn from experiences of others (and more importantly in some cases, there is no substitute for one's own personal experience). This book covers a lot of topics from mentoring, project management, test driven development, career enhancement, handling pressure etc. A few ideas took me by surprise - for instance, the author states that the true benefit of mentorship is for the mentor - I never thought of it that way. I certainly don't agree with everything in this book although I can appreciate the author's perspective most of the time. For instance, there are a fair number of references and comparisons to medical profession which in my personal opinion are not really appropriate given how different both professions are. On the other hand, I can validate others by looking back - for instance the author talks about allowing teams to gel and once that's done high productivity is achieved and therefore a gelled team shouldn't be broken. There are some good ideas in this book which I plan to try out and see how well they work. Overall this book is definitely worth a read for entry level folks and not really necessary for folks with profession experience.

"Foundations of Game Engine Development, Volume 1: Mathematics",43.83,4.6,"I am a game developer at a triple A studio. Although the book was hard, I read and reread it so thoroughly that it helped me really grasp the fundamentals of linear algebra. In fact, the introduction to Geometric algebra (in the last chapter) gave me the tools to be able to reconstruct the learnings from the rest of the book. It taught me a lot of new things and it deepened my understanding of the things I already knew. It really boosted the confidence in my math skills and already it has greatly impacting my professional career.There are a few sections that I thought were too hard. Sometimes a conclusion is given but I wasn't able to work out the proof with the things I was taught. So in addition I spent quite a lot of time digging through study material on the web from other sources to teach me enough to do it. Those brain-wreckers are perhaps a weakness to the book, but if you refuse to give up it does make the lessons stick a lot better.I did however give up the second halve of questions provided at the end of chapter 3. I couldn't understand the answers in the solution guide no matter how much I learned and I felt it wasn't very fruitful to do so. It's the set of questions about Pl√ºcker coordinates. The tools handed in chapter 4 give a better intuition to the problems, so I recommend revisiting those questions after you finished the book.I've ordered part 2 and can't wait for 3 and 4 to release.This book teaches you some math that none of my colleagues knew about, and that includes 2 people with a PhD in Mathematics. I assure you though, knowing this is a tool in your belt that gives you an advantage that you won't easily forget about.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"Okay, 1 year using and 1 year to learn so as to give a real review, it's not some 4k ultimate video recording doorbell, but the video is clear enough and dollar for dollar it might be one of the better 1080 doorbells, it does have some issues I found work arounds for and some I couldn't, the reviews you read saying it's very slow to motion alert you are not just hard to please customers, it is an issue, It is slow to alert you thru the app on your phone, why I have not a clue, the work around is if you have Echo Dot or Echo Show and you know how to set up routines, have Alexa tell you when that device detects motion, I found it lightning quick, why that works faster I don't know, lol, remember I'm doing honest review on how things worked for me. I also discovered you can have Echo Show or Echo Dot be your chime so again if you understand Alexa routines, and you have alexa devices, you will never have an issue hearing when someone rings your blink Doorbell, don't forget to link your Blink app and the Alexa app to ensure the above things work for you, okay on to issue I can't find a work around, Blinks idea of battery life reminds me of auto manufacturers MPG estimates, we all know in the real world it's not going to happen, sure, if you dial down all the features, you might get half of what Blink says, but then I ask you, why have it, we buy them to use them right ?, so I have found average battery life even using the suggested energizer ultimate lithium, is about 6 months, not 2 years and don't care how they or their paid reviewers try to spin it, it's not going to happen even if you dial all the features down, making it a waste of money, and yes I'm using the sync module which is supposed to help battery life, maybe it does, can't answer that but real life, no B.S. spinning, your not going to come close to their battery projections, my only work around for that is the batteries are easy to change and I understand and can deal with this, Speaking of the Blink module, I use it for local storage and I also use the pay for cloud storage, that's another non work around issue, far far to many features are LOCKED OUT, if you don't pay for the Blink subscription, Now if you don't care about saving videos and you just want to know who is at your door regardless if you are home or away, this will alert you, it will display to you video of who and allow you to talk to them also and I must say it does a good job at it and you don't need the blink subscription and if you do have the Blink module and a usb stick in, it will save those for you, at short lengths, but it will do it. Overall it is a good security device, and although obviously it is far from the better ones. From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this, , easy to install, no wires, pretty much can put it where you want it, Again it does everything pretty well, One of the best prices out there, just understand it has shortcomings, but also understand it's price, and it will certainly do the job for you, this isn't a trashing review, I tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it, it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others, but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another, remember, you can put them about anywhere, I actually have one stashed at the front of my house, not by the door, it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away, sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not, weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them, including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain, snow and cold, it has held up well, still ticking, no signs of wear, so another plus

"Amazon Echo Pop | Full sound compact smart speaker with Alexa | Lavender Bloom",43.83,4.7,"I have been kind of systematically replacing all of the echo dots around my house. I use them for home automation as well as voice control. They are also very handy for communication in the house in other rooms.I love how Amazon has a trade-in program to bring the price down even more.This new speaker is such a great improvement from the echo dot. The aesthetics on it are very nice and I like how it can fit into the corner of a desk or countertop. The sound on it is fantastic and if I didn‚Äôt have built-in speakers around the house, I would definitely use this for room to room Music.One of the things I was surprised to learn and I love, I use the Eero mesh network in my house. Of course since both are Amazon products, they work well together. But what‚Äôs great is that when you plug in the new echo pop, it quickly connects to the network and can tell if you need a Wi-Fi extender in that area. It, itself, is a Wi-Fi extender. When I set one of them up, it extended the Wi-Fi to that part of the house. But in another area, I set up the echo pop and it determined on its own that I didn‚Äôt need additional coverage in that area. Call me simple, but that is freaking cool.Highly recommend.

"Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 Release) in Charcoal bundle with TP-Link Kasa Smart Color Bulb",43.83,4.7,"I've had earlier versions of the Echo Show/Dot, etc it was time for an upgrade, the last one had taken a beating. I was arguing with it constantly and somehow fragrance wax had been spilled all over it and as dastardly as it appeared, it was still kicking. However one arguement too many and played a hard game of basketball with it and it was time to get another one. When the combo sale popped up in the Black Friday festivities (Nov 2023) I took full advantage. Once the product arrived, which in stride with Amazon's standards arrived the very next day, and I was eager to install. Of course I immediately handed to my assistant to install, he did a phenominal job, said it was very easy. He even got the light to work right away.l I love the idea that I can adjust the light to any color I desire on the spectrum and as bright as I like. If they made it in a grow light it would be even more amazing, I'm kinda wondering if it has that capabilities with the range of colors, but that's another day I reckon. Light works with voice command very easily. I'd ask Alexa for some suggestions or you will be standing there yelling commands over and over to no one in particular, cuz she won't be listening. But once Alexa so generously gave me a suggestion, I was off and running. My favorite setting is low enough to employ as a nighht light, so that is exactly what i do with it. As far as the Alexa, i do like the new shape and the sound is great. She does seem tempermental sometimes. We do still argue. (We're considering counseling) About the only difference I am not really a fan of is the volume buttons. On the dots, you only had to touch the command button and on the latest version you do have to push the command button down. It takes longer to adjust the volume and I feel like I'm mashing the device, but it hasn't. Other than that no complaints.

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"I purchased this Alexa enabled Echo Show for my remote office. I find great utility in the three other Echo Show devices already deployed throughout my home as well as the multiple Alexa enabled echo devices sharing both private and common areas in my home as well as my automobile.Alexa is always happy to handle the routine tasks associated with the day to day operations of a modern smart home.The interface to a variety of complimentary systems from multiple Amazon partners makes Alexa enabled devices like the Echo Show 3 an indispensable part of the modern connected family.I routinely introduce my friends and colleagues to my Alexa enabled FireTVs (all six of them), one 1st generation Echo, a 2nd generation Echo with a battery unit providing portability throughout my garden, 7 (yes, 7) Echo Dots beginning at the first edition and continuing to the most current version and I‚Äôm planning even more.Fidelity with such small speakers is great and a nice surprise from an unexpected place. The display is a little small but it‚Äôs very sharp and it‚Äôs color representation is great.Personally I love the video call feature because it helps keep me in touch with my friends around the world. Of course I had to get them Alexa enabled Echo Shows, too.Heck, I even gifted and installed 6 other Echo Dots along with a single Echo Show to one of our local nonprofits. I added automation to the buildings HVAC systems through Google Nest controls integrated with Alexa and I have plans to automate even more.To say I‚Äôm a fan of all of my Alexa-enabled products is an understatement.If your creative, the developers kit makes writing your own routines a breeze. Imagine an infinitely configurable group of smart home devices making your life easier. I know, I did it.  I think everyone should make this technological leap too.It‚Äôs not AI enabled but it‚Äôs Natural Language Processing capabilities make all of my Alexa enabled products shine!If you don‚Äôt yet have one or two or twenty-something Alexa enabled devices in your home or office you are missing out! Trust me, I don‚Äôt want to go back to any time of my life without Alexa. That says it all.

"Amazon Fire TV Stick, HD, sharp picture quality, fast streaming, free & live TV, Alexa Voice Remote with TV controls",43.83,4.7,"Let me prequalify this review stating that I have been an Amazon Firestick and Fire TV and Fire TV Recast user almost since they've first come out.  I've purchased about 20 of these over my lifetime so far, so I have considerable experience with them.  So my requests are probably not beginner requests but things I've noticed over time.There are a few crucial features I think should be added to Firestick to make them a game-changing option.1) The faster processing when changing menues.  The firstick is great but becomes sluggish over time.  Short of a full factor reset it would be nice to have a way to clear and manage memory better.  Also optimized screen display with perhaps text placeholders before images are displayed.  Sometimes the menus take up to 20-50 seconds to come up.2) Pictue-in-Picture mode.  It would be a great addition to allow picture in picture so you can be previewing a local news channel, youtube or other live content while watching a movie.3) Multi-screen capability to be able to connect multiple HDMI devices or synchronize between firestick devices for a single control point.  An example of this would be where video has extended content, displayed it on a second screen.  Or create a multi-screen wide-screen for a panorama effect.4) Skill panels as an extensible video overlay.  For example, have skills for different overlay tasks suck as a SmartHome panel or Stock Ticker panel that you can enable to overlay on a box on the screen or along the bottom ticker.5) Internal Volume - the ability to control volume directly from the Firestick device for those TVs or sound bars that do not easily integrate with the remote.  This is especially handy when streaming the audio via the HDMI output.

From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this,  , easy to install,  no wires,  pretty much can put it where you want it,  Again it does everything pretty well,  One of the best prices out there,  just understand it has shortcomings,  but also understand it's price,  and it will certainly do the job for you,  this isn't a trashing review,  I  tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it,  it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others,  but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another,  remember,  you can put them about anywhere,  I actually have one stashed at the front of my house,  not by the door,  it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away,  sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not,  weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them,  including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain,  snow and cold,  it has held up well,  still ticking,  no signs of wear,  so another plus

"Amazon Echo Pop | Full sound compact smart speaker with Alexa | Lavender Bloom",43.83,4.7,"I love this lil speaker, I figured charcoal matches everything, but now contemplating purchasing an additional echo pop in lavender for the bedroom & using the charcoal one in the bathroom or something. It's such a a great deal and excellent sound quality, ya just can't beat it.I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the quality and volume of this echo pop. Unfortunately my home was robbed and the thieves had stolen my Echo Show & one of my echo dots, I didn't have a lot of money to purchase another device, so with this being on sale 50% off, I decided to try it and I am glad I did. I think it actually sounds better than the show & dot, although my show was an older generation but the dot was fairly new. Either way, I am very pleased with the quality of this device. It was super easy to set up and I am grateful that it automatically links to my account. Plus I am grateful to be able to completely deactivate the stolen devices so they can't be used or registered to anyone else.

"Amazon Echo Pop | Full sound compact smart speaker with Alexa | Lavender Bloom",43.83,4.7,"I wanted a smart speaker for my bathroom. I have horrible ADHD, and have issues with time management, especially in the shower. I bought it for that specific need, but music in the shower is nice, and the convenience of not lugging a bluetooth speaker all over was tempting. I bought this during the holidays when it was on sale for $18. Best $18 I've ever spent. As of this writing, it is on sale for $25, which is not bad at all.For the size and the price, especially if you buy it on sale, it's a no brainer. All the functionality of an Echo speaker in half the size, and at a perfectly reasonable price. It's not audiophile sound, but it sounds great especially for its size. I have an Echo Show 5th Gen. I'd say it's a notch below in terms of quality, but honestly not by much. I used to have a Google Home speaker, and the Echo Pop certainly kicks the crap out of that thing.The speaker truly has helped with its intended purpose. No more being late for work from daydreaming in the shower. Setup was incredibly easy. This technology has made many aspects of my life a lot easier. Plus, jamming out in the shower is a great way to start the day. This was a good purchase. I'm very happy with this little guy.

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"UPDATE 6 WEEKS LATER:Amazon has made some noteworthy improvements with subsequent software updates.Ambient Experience: It's still a bit laggy - Amazon has more optimizing work to be done here. But it's not nearly as bad. Also, originally the Ambient Experience always shut off after only 14 minutes and there was no option to change that; but Amazon has added options to set a longer timeout, including up to several hours or ""never."" The AE isn't perfect, but it's much better now.Permissions: Amazon added in the Manage All Files permission with the 8.1.0.1 firmware update, and it works correctly. They could do a better job at documenting this - you have to know to go into settings and manually grant the permission, you can't do this in a pop-up permission request - but it does work, so that's an important fix. The other permission differences (like Nearby Devices) are, in fairness, only really for use with sideloaded apps for power users, so it's no surprise that Amazon hasn't added those into the interface.Some users had experienced that problem that sideloaded apps showed blank icons, but Amazon fixed that very quickly.There are still other minor glitches with Fire OS 8, but it's much more stable already, and working well for its primary purpose - streaming. I think the Max is shaping up to be a reasonable and much cheaper alternative to the Fire TV Cube now for those who don't need the hands-free voice and HDMI input. The Max is also much faster and with double the storage compared to the sluggish Chromecast with Google TV.A note on the remote control: unfortunately, after a few days the solid-feeling remote control loosened up. The upside is that the battery cover comes off more easily now. But the bad part is that the remote is now *very* creaky and feels so loose it's almost like it could come apart in your hand with ordinary usage. It doesn't, but it sure feels cheap.ORIGINAL REVIEW:For context, I've been using the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen as my primary streaming device for several months, after trying a number of Android TV devices and having problems with all of them. I got the new Fire Stick Max 2nd Gen to try out Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.It turns out that Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience are the problem here.The hardware is the best I've used in a streaming stick or dongle. Snappy and responsive overall, great wifi, plenty of storage. In fact, in browsing the UI and launching apps, the Max is not far behind the Cube, and wifi is every bit as good.But the Ambient Experience is a problem. It's a good idea, it looks nice, and it has lots of options. But those options are rather confusing. More importantly, the AE is disastrously laggy. When customizing, it'll lag long enough you'd think it didn't register a button press at all. When launching the AE, the screen goes completely blank for several seconds as if the TV was shut off, before very slowly loading the image and widgets. It needs a ton of optimizing before it's any good.And Fire OS 8 based on Android 11 is a problem here too. What's the same from Fire TV 7/Android 9 still works just fine, but some of what's changed is broken.Most notably, Android 10 and 11 introduced lots of permissions changes that required apps to be modified and users to adjust their settings. And Amazon seems to have totally missed out on that for Fire OS 8. The most obvious is storage permissions: in Fire OS 8, file managers and other apps that access storage like VLC - apps that are in the Amazon Appstore - are just completely broken, because there's no way in the UI to grant the new storage permissions. (Storage permission is listed in settings, but it doesn't work.) These changes were announced more than 4 years ago and were very widely discussed and reported on throughout the Android world, so there's no excuse for Amazon not to have addressed that in preparing Fire OS 8. (The permission can be granted at the command line using adb, but that is cumbersome and should not be needed just to let a file manager manage files.) There are other permissions issues, too, but storage is the glaring serious problem.Quick note on the remote: although it's the same buttons, size, and shape as the remote with the Cube, the build quality is quite different. The Cube remote feels really cheaply built and is creaky and slippery; the Max remote feels like good quality and doesn't creak. On the other hand, it's really difficult to open the battery cover on the Max remote.Amazon has done a good job with the hardware on the Max 2nd Gen. But they have a lot of work to do to optimize and fix bugs in Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.

It has a comfortable angle and rolls nicely.The assembly was somewhat annoying. I put it together by myself and it likely would have been easier with someone else. It can be a little tricky to hold parts of it while screwing in the bolts at times. Also, on mine, one of the wheels really didn't want to go in. I tried everything I could, but eventually, I had to take the base outside and smack it on the ground to get it to pop in. Now it works fine.The last issue I would mention here is that the padding on the seat bottom is a little weak, but the back is fine. If you're going to frequently sit on it for long periods of time, I'd recommend an additional cushion. I have mild sciatica, so this is what I did and its find now.Overall, not perfect, but a solid deal for the money and I definitely don't regret this purchase

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"The short answer is this is a very good device, and I would recommend it. So why 4 stars? Well, I am basing this on the 1st GEN of the Show 5 and just Alexia issues in general. I will list the cons first and then get to the positive. The 1st GEN and 2nd GEN are basically the same almost no difference from what I understand.- My overall biggest issue and this is all Alexia devices, she just does not listen. Basically she is temperamental! She thinks you say something other than what you said or just makes suggestions for no reason. When you ask her to stop it is not fast at all. AMAZON FIX THIS!!!!!!! This is sort of like a partner or friend that is upset and will not stop talking. Yes, you know what I am talking about‚Ä¶.lol- The software OR firmware needs to be updated or improved. Amazon absolutely needs to have a enable or disable all for all the screen options. For example, most people turn off nearly all the options in the Home and Clock area; there are a ton, and you need to do one-by-one.- When making changes, there is a delay. Took nearly 3 or 4 min for the clock interface to change. Should be immediate and then if I don't like to allow me to go back. Instead, I make a change and I thought was broken because nothing happens; tried 5 times After a few min it finally switched.- Improved, however, there is still a big delay the touch screen.- Amazon really needs give you the options to have her stop telling asking you if you want to buy amazon music if you ask to listen to a particular artist. It will play it but first tells asks if you want to buy music for X $ a month.THE POSITIVES:+ The Sound is greatly improved except for her voice itself. If listening to music, you 100% do get better sound from the previous version. Main reason I got it.+ The screen size is the same, but the body is a smaller footprint.+ It is no longer rectangular, but more of a curved design so just looks nicer.+ As I mentioned earlier, the touch screen is better but still not great. However, it is a little faster and not worse so I guess a win.Overall it boils down to this‚Ä¶.. if you have a 1st or 2nd gen and you are happy with the audio then skip it not necessary. However, if you want better sound for music then I say it‚Äôs worth it. If you do not have any Show device the 5 is a nice choice especially if using on a nightstand.

"Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled ‚Äî wired or wire-free (Black)",43.83,4.3,"Alexa was paired by Amazon with just the blinks. So I bought the two blinks and Alexa, then after that purchase, I  discovered I  had to buy two sync modules, and then two large thumb drives to avoid the monthly cloud fee.  Then I had to buy motion lights because blink does NOT have night vision.  Alexa is cool b8ut she does not show you the blink, she just says motion detected at the blink camera, she doesn't even say if it is the front or back door.  After buying all of this you still have to use your cell to control and use all of it.  Blink has a large view area but they have to be right up on it to make it alert so if your car is parked 25 feet away and someone breaks into it without walking by the door first you are screwed but you can catch your neighbor in a fender bender when someone thinks you hit their car.  So it has true value.

"Amazon Echo Pop | Full sound compact smart speaker with Alexa | Lavender Bloom",43.83,4.7,"I wanted a smart speaker for my bathroom. I have horrible ADHD, and have issues with time management, especially in the shower. I bought it for that specific need, but music in the shower is nice, and the convenience of not lugging a bluetooth speaker all over was tempting. I bought this during the holidays when it was on sale for $18. Best $18 I've ever spent. As of this writing, it is on sale for $25, which is not bad at all.For the size and the price, especially if you buy it on sale, it's a no brainer. All the functionality of an Echo speaker in half the size, and at a perfectly reasonable price. It's not audiophile sound, but it sounds great especially for its size. I have an Echo Show 5th Gen. I'd say it's a notch below in terms of quality, but honestly not by much. I used to have a Google Home speaker, and the Echo Pop certainly kicks the crap out of that thing.The speaker truly has helped with its intended purpose. No more being late for work from daydreaming in the shower. Setup was incredibly easy. This technology has made many aspects of my life a lot easier. Plus, jamming out in the shower is a great way to start the day. This was a good purchase. I'm very happy with this little guy.

"Certified Refurbished Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) | HD smart display with motion and Alexa | Charcoal",43.83,4.4,"I own many Echo devices, but this was the first Show device I've purchased. I primarily wanted to use this as a central hub in the kitchen and have the option to control our smart home devices from a central point, too.Overall, the Show 10 works really well. The display and sound quality are fantastic, so I'd definitely recommend if you plan to watch video or stream music regularly from it.As a smart home hub, it does OK. The device dashboard is nice and the screen size is great for that purpose but, like Fire tablets, the device can be pretty slow at bringing up screens when asked.The motion capability is really useful for video calling, and we use the Show in a fairly long room, so it is good to be able to see the screen from multiple spots. It is also a nice feature if you want to use the camera as a security device, too.Annoyingly, despite multiple recalibrations, the detection is always a little off and the screen will swing slightly past directly where I'm standing. It's not enough to prevent easy use of the device, but I expected more precision out of a state of the art device with this price tag.The lack of ability to self-tilt is also a drawback since I have young children. Oftentimes, when they talk to the device and I happen to be in the kitchen, the device will swing to look at and move with me instead of them.By far my biggest disappointment, though, has been the voice recognition/activation. It feels like a step back from older Echo models. Often, I have to directly face the device and speak loudly in order to get it to pay attention and sometimes it doesn't even understand the command.I have an old second gen Echo in a completely different room that I had to change the wake word for because it consistently picked up the commands, even amidst background TV noise, far better than this device does.Overall, I like the device and don't regret the purchase but, unless the motion capability is a necessity for you, it's absolutely not worth it's full price given the issues it has. I bought a refurbished version because of the high price point, but even then, I still think isn't value for money compared to other similar products, like the newer Fire tablets.

"Marvel Design Vault Club T-Shirt Subscription - Men - Large",43.83,4.3,"This shirt was well made, soft and good quality. The sizing was true. my only drawback was I did not care for the design of the first shirt I got.

And I will be happy to wait for a few months designs before deciding to keep it or let it go.  Updates will follow.Update March 2021:  Well after having been a subscriber for a few months, I must say I have mixed reviews. The shirts are good quality and sized to fit pretty accurately. The designs are mostly great , ( I have only had one design I did not like.) however the printing quality is kinda sloppy. The Deadpool shirt came in with printing blotch on the bottom of the design, and the Knowhere shirt design was awesome but mine was printed crooked. However the X men shirt and the latest Black Panther shirt have been perfect. However they have been great about returns as well , either for quality or for just not liking the design. All in all I really like the subscription but, think they could make it better simply by giving the ability to get a replacement for shirt that has a problem, now you can send it back , but you cant just get a replacement.  Making a batch of extra shirts would solve this problem and not make Amazon have to refund so many mistakes, just replace it. I really hated to send back the shirt I liked the most so far and really would have preferred a replacement. But at least for now I'm still in. Perhaps the process is improving, because I really do enjoy the program.

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device, more than 1.5 million movies and TV episodes, supports Wi-Fi 6, watch free & live TV",43.83,4.7,NA,4.7,"amazon-smp","None",NA,"Unknown"
"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"UPDATE 6 WEEKS LATER:Amazon has made some noteworthy improvements with subsequent software updates.Ambient Experience: It's still a bit laggy - Amazon has more optimizing work to be done here. But it's not nearly as bad. Also, originally the Ambient Experience always shut off after only 14 minutes and there was no option to change that; but Amazon has added options to set a longer timeout, including up to several hours or ""never."" The AE isn't perfect, but it's much better now.Permissions: Amazon added in the Manage All Files permission with the 8.1.0.1 firmware update, and it works correctly. They could do a better job at documenting this - you have to know to go into settings and manually grant the permission, you can't do this in a pop-up permission request - but it does work, so that's an important fix. The other permission differences (like Nearby Devices) are, in fairness, only really for use with sideloaded apps for power users, so it's no surprise that Amazon hasn't added those into the interface.Some users had experienced that problem that sideloaded apps showed blank icons, but Amazon fixed that very quickly.There are still other minor glitches with Fire OS 8, but it's much more stable already, and working well for its primary purpose - streaming. I think the Max is shaping up to be a reasonable and much cheaper alternative to the Fire TV Cube now for those who don't need the hands-free voice and HDMI input. The Max is also much faster and with double the storage compared to the sluggish Chromecast with Google TV.A note on the remote control: unfortunately, after a few days the solid-feeling remote control loosened up. The upside is that the battery cover comes off more easily now. But the bad part is that the remote is now *very* creaky and feels so loose it's almost like it could come apart in your hand with ordinary usage. It doesn't, but it sure feels cheap.ORIGINAL REVIEW:For context, I've been using the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen as my primary streaming device for several months, after trying a number of Android TV devices and having problems with all of them. I got the new Fire Stick Max 2nd Gen to try out Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.It turns out that Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience are the problem here.The hardware is the best I've used in a streaming stick or dongle. Snappy and responsive overall, great wifi, plenty of storage. In fact, in browsing the UI and launching apps, the Max is not far behind the Cube, and wifi is every bit as good.But the Ambient Experience is a problem. It's a good idea, it looks nice, and it has lots of options. But those options are rather confusing. More importantly, the AE is disastrously laggy. When customizing, it'll lag long enough you'd think it didn't register a button press at all. When launching the AE, the screen goes completely blank for several seconds as if the TV was shut off, before very slowly loading the image and widgets. It needs a ton of optimizing before it's any good.And Fire OS 8 based on Android 11 is a problem here too. What's the same from Fire TV 7/Android 9 still works just fine, but some of what's changed is broken.Most notably, Android 10 and 11 introduced lots of permissions changes that required apps to be modified and users to adjust their settings. And Amazon seems to have totally missed out on that for Fire OS 8. The most obvious is storage permissions: in Fire OS 8, file managers and other apps that access storage like VLC - apps that are in the Amazon Appstore - are just completely broken, because there's no way in the UI to grant the new storage permissions. (Storage permission is listed in settings, but it doesn't work.) These changes were announced more than 4 years ago and were very widely discussed and reported on throughout the Android world, so there's no excuse for Amazon not to have addressed that in preparing Fire OS 8. (The permission can be granted at the command line using adb, but that is cumbersome and should not be needed just to let a file manager manage files.) There are other permissions issues, too, but storage is the glaring serious problem.Quick note on the remote: although it's the same buttons, size, and shape as the remote with the Cube, the build quality is quite different. The Cube remote feels really cheaply built and is creaky and slippery; the Max remote feels like good quality and doesn't creak. On the other hand, it's really difficult to open the battery cover on the Max remote.Amazon has done a good job with the hardware on the Max 2nd Gen. But they have a lot of work to do to optimize and fix bugs in Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.

I ordered a larger size first for my yorkie then it looked a little too big on him when I put it on so I reordered another smaller sized one and it's just perfect. It's engraving is etched pretty deep not just printed on or something that might easily wear off - this tag looks like it will last a long time and hold up. It's very thick metal and won't bend or break. I thought the price was definitely reasonable especially considering the custom engraving.

"20 Pack Vacuum Storage Bags, Space Saver Bags (4 Jumbo/4 Large/4 Medium/4 Small/4 Roll) Compression for Comforters and Blankets, Sealer Clothes Storage, Hand Pump Included",43.83,4.3,"I'm using these vacuum-seal bags for all our camp bedding that isn't a sleeping bag. The bags are thick plastic and the suction hole is mid-way down the bag. Each bag has a double zip-lock to provide a better seal.The vacuum pump easily took a queen size pillow that was about 10"" thick and compacted it down to about 1"" ‚Äì see pics. For reference, I used the medium-sized bag for the pillow. The medium-sized bag also perfectly fit a folded 72""x96"" soft blanket. In a small bag, I got 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and 2 washcloths with room to spare. These 9 items used to take up a full tote but after compacting them down, I have room enough for 2 more blankets, 2 more towels, 2 more hand towels, and 2 more washcloths in that same tote.The pump screws right onto the bags, making it very easy to evacuate the air ‚Äì no tedious fiddling around with it or trying to hold it together. Also, when you remove the pump, the vacuum seal holds fast even before the cap is screwed back on.The pump doesn't seem that sturdy but I accidentally dropped it on concrete twice and both times I was expecting to see it broken...but it held together and still worked.To make the job a bit quicker, after stuffing a bag and sealing the zip-locks, you can open the suction hole and use your hands to gently apply pressure to the bags to purge excess air before actually using the pump. It's quite a bit faster and your arm muscles will thank you.One tiny issue is that the bags are not marked for size (that I could see) so I had to unfold one bag after another until I found the right size ‚Äì then, when refolding the unused bags, they didn't really follow the ""lines"" from the previous folds very well so I wasn't able to get them back to the small footprint they shipped in. To avoid this issue in the future, I marked the bags with an initial to denote the sizes and carefully refolded them so that my marks were still easily visible. You may want to do the same; I used T for tiny, S for small, M for medium, L for large, and J for jumbo.

Once I did that, I could install the Google Apps I normally use and now I'm a happy camper.Note that to install the Play store is a best done by someone with experience downloading and installing ""APK"" files.To find the article on installing the Play Store search for:""install play store on fire tablet""

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"The short answer is this is a very good device, and I would recommend it. So why 4 stars? Well, I am basing this on the 1st GEN of the Show 5 and just Alexia issues in general. I will list the cons first and then get to the positive. The 1st GEN and 2nd GEN are basically the same almost no difference from what I understand.- My overall biggest issue and this is all Alexia devices, she just does not listen. Basically she is temperamental! She thinks you say something other than what you said or just makes suggestions for no reason. When you ask her to stop it is not fast at all. AMAZON FIX THIS!!!!!!! This is sort of like a partner or friend that is upset and will not stop talking. Yes, you know what I am talking about‚Ä¶.lol- The software OR firmware needs to be updated or improved. Amazon absolutely needs to have a enable or disable all for all the screen options. For example, most people turn off nearly all the options in the Home and Clock area; there are a ton, and you need to do one-by-one.- When making changes, there is a delay. Took nearly 3 or 4 min for the clock interface to change. Should be immediate and then if I don't like to allow me to go back. Instead, I make a change and I thought was broken because nothing happens; tried 5 times After a few min it finally switched.- Improved, however, there is still a big delay the touch screen.- Amazon really needs give you the options to have her stop telling asking you if you want to buy amazon music if you ask to listen to a particular artist. It will play it but first tells asks if you want to buy music for X $ a month.THE POSITIVES:+ The Sound is greatly improved except for her voice itself. If listening to music, you 100% do get better sound from the previous version. Main reason I got it.+ The screen size is the same, but the body is a smaller footprint.+ It is no longer rectangular, but more of a curved design so just looks nicer.+ As I mentioned earlier, the touch screen is better but still not great. However, it is a little faster and not worse so I guess a win.Overall it boils down to this‚Ä¶.. if you have a 1st or 2nd gen and you are happy with the audio then skip it not necessary. However, if you want better sound for music then I say it‚Äôs worth it. If you do not have any Show device the 5 is a nice choice especially if using on a nightstand.

"All Good People Here: A Novel",43.83,4.4,"All Good People Here by Ashley Flowers is the perfect small-town mystery. I was insanely invested in this story and wanted so bad for there to be some kind of big revelation so when I got to the end, I was a little let down. Too much is left open for speculation. HOWEVER, I sat on my thoughts for a few hours before writing up my review and I have to say I LOVE how this book ended. All the buildup from the story still weighs heavily on me but when I put it in perspective, it comes off as REAL. Not every case will be wrapped up in a pretty bow with answers to all the questions we have. Perhaps more things will come to light later down the road (and maybe even another book?) and perhaps not. But that is REAL crime so this book, while frustrating in that aspect, really made it stand out to me over other mysteries I‚Äôve read.All in all, I loved this one! I can see why it‚Äôs been so popular among thriller fans, and I can also see why people may not have loved it. The book is extremely detail oriented, suspenseful, and intriguing for those who enjoy a book that deals with true crime cases. However, it doesn‚Äôt have a perfect ending which will leave some readers feeling annoyed. Either way, I do recommend and am crossing my fingers that the author continues to write because I‚Äôm a fan!ùó£ùóòùó•ùóôùóòùóñùóß ùóôùó¢ùó• ùóôùóîùó°ùó¶ ùó¢ùóô‚ù• Small Town Mysteries‚ù• Murder Mysteries‚ù• Cold case type books with shocking twists and turnsùó†ùó¨ ùó•ùóîùóßùóúùó°ùóö: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

"The Teacher",43.83,4.3,"The story was just fine. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a psychological thriller for adults, and even I read a lot of young adult books and i thought m it was just fine. I didn‚Äôt think it was bad, didn‚Äôt think it was great. It had a good story and it kept me reading til the end, which Is good! The ending was awesome but (spoiler) kinda confusing with the shoe store (is it father son? Is Hudson supposed to be jay? How could he be if he goes to the school, the teacher would have know him??)My problem with this book is that is for the first 3/4 of the book I was waiting for the hammer to drop and there just wasn‚Äôt really enough to keep me going and then the last 1/4 of the book everything happens at once. I love a good point of view chapter reading so I think that kept me invested through to the end. Anyways, all in all, definitely wasn‚Äôt a bad read! Would recommend if you enjoy young adult novels, which. I do.

After reading the first book, I couldn‚Äôt wait to read the second, and the same for the third. This wasn‚Äôt the Arthur I knew from childhood tales or ‚ÄúCamelot,‚Äù but even a more heroic figure. This was Arthur the warrior.Cornwell draws his characters so well, sets the scene well, makes you care for each character as if they were sitting across from you at a fire ring at a campsite. I cried when Arthur went down and was carried off to the ship for his final voyage. The battle scenes were so real you could almost smell the salt from the sea, feel the sand under your felt and see the blood spurting from bodies.I hate that there‚Äôs not another book in the chronicles. Now I have to leave the world of Dumnonia and delve into another world. Bravo, Bernard Cornwell!

Her ever-changing role in her dysfunctional family of deities is an astounding transformation. She had me cheering and tearing up for her strength of character and her courage to take on life as it came at her.I have never been one to get pulled in by mythology, but Madeline Miller makes me want to go back and read some classic literature. Bravo for her fresh take on this age-old story.

My great-grandmother lived through the Great Depression and would talk about the effects here in Northern Vermont. Her experience even shaped how my grandmother stored food, always ready for shortage and to some degree my mother.To live through the Dust Bowl or many of the horrible times when there was never enough of anything and basic human needs were ignored by those who had more than enough but chose to lie to themselves and cast those who by no fault of their own lost everything, as if they chose to live that way, disgusting.  I was so angry many times that I definitely identified with Loreda! But only bc I always had enough and an abundance of love!I was taught to always look out for those who had less than you did, eben if what you have isn't much, and I'm grateful for that legacy.

"A Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 5)",43.83,4.8,"This book is one of my favorite books of all time.The journey Nesta takes in terms of mental health is similar to my own. Watching her find herself through movement, meditation, and trauma bonding with new friends feels like I am watching my own story back ‚Ä¶ but if I was Fae with super powers.Watching Nesta transform from reactive to being able to accept love again is beyond special and honestly important in our escapist books. SO many people hate Nesta and don't love this book but I think that is the point. Nesta is a great example of someone who experiences trauma and becomes very destructive through it. We need more characters like Nesta. If you are someone who hates her maybe get a little introspective and figure out WHY because honestly this book is a therapy session in itself.Cassian also has to be one of my favorite men who are written by a woman. He is kind and understanding. Cassian gives Nesta what she needs to find herself. He doesn't do it for her which is an element I love about this story. He is a strong support and the only person that holds her up when things are at their worst. I am lucky enough to have a couple of Cassian's in my life and his character makes me so emotional. I love him.Nesta finding her way alongside two other strong female characters is also a mood. She learns how to love her family again but then creates a family of her own and in turn they all heal each other. I just love the story of women uplifting other women to reach their best versions of themselves. Watching them train and become more confident is so much fun and had me in tears by the end.Honestly I have read this multiple times now and its exactly what kind of escapism I have needed to get through some difficult times. I cry every single time in that last couple hundred pages because I am so proud of these characters. I love them so much and its hard to fathom that they are just some in on paper. To me they are real.

"The Creative Act: A Way of Being",43.83,4.7,"I will consistently be referencing this book throughout my creative process. What this book does is offers an alternative perspective on creativity, and gives page at the page of a great advice on how to come up with ideas, brainstorm, and execute creative projects.As a Christian, I found it interesting that he views creativity, as spiritual essentially, also find it interesting that he used a lot of Bible scriptures. A lot of his teachings appears to have stemmed from scripture, whether he will admit it or not. I‚Äôve annotated mine to point out all of the scripture, because he would quote verse by verse, but not credit the BibleNonetheless, I refer to this book as the Bible for creatives. Not to get this any sort of divine context, but to me, it provides a lot of unknown information.If you are a believer, do Reed with discernment, as he mentions the so-called universe, being so perfectly created in genius and broadcasting ideas, he does not mention that this universe he speaks of is a spiritual realm that has both negative and positive ideas. Please test all ideas to see if they thrive from memorial perspectiveFor example, and rap music, we may see that music artist have great ideas, but a lot of times it had lead to evil. Though this idea may have a good beat, the root of it clearly shows where it came from

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"The short answer is this is a very good device, and I would recommend it. So why 4 stars? Well, I am basing this on the 1st GEN of the Show 5 and just Alexia issues in general. I will list the cons first and then get to the positive. The 1st GEN and 2nd GEN are basically the same almost no difference from what I understand.- My overall biggest issue and this is all Alexia devices, she just does not listen. Basically she is temperamental! She thinks you say something other than what you said or just makes suggestions for no reason. When you ask her to stop it is not fast at all. AMAZON FIX THIS!!!!!!! This is sort of like a partner or friend that is upset and will not stop talking. Yes, you know what I am talking about‚Ä¶.lol- The software OR firmware needs to be updated or improved. Amazon absolutely needs to have a enable or disable all for all the screen options. For example, most people turn off nearly all the options in the Home and Clock area; there are a ton, and you need to do one-by-one.- When making changes, there is a delay. Took nearly 3 or 4 min for the clock interface to change. Should be immediate and then if I don't like to allow me to go back. Instead, I make a change and I thought was broken because nothing happens; tried 5 times After a few min it finally switched.- Improved, however, there is still a big delay the touch screen.- Amazon really needs give you the options to have her stop telling asking you if you want to buy amazon music if you ask to listen to a particular artist. It will play it but first tells asks if you want to buy music for X $ a month.THE POSITIVES:+ The Sound is greatly improved except for her voice itself. If listening to music, you 100% do get better sound from the previous version. Main reason I got it.+ The screen size is the same, but the body is a smaller footprint.+ It is no longer rectangular, but more of a curved design so just looks nicer.+ As I mentioned earlier, the touch screen is better but still not great. However, it is a little faster and not worse so I guess a win.Overall it boils down to this‚Ä¶.. if you have a 1st or 2nd gen and you are happy with the audio then skip it not necessary. However, if you want better sound for music then I say it‚Äôs worth it. If you do not have any Show device the 5 is a nice choice especially if using on a nightstand.

At first there is a weird scent but you‚Äôll get used to it because I don‚Äôt smell it anymore. Make sure your face is damp and emulsify for about 5 seconds then put on face.

"Quest 2 ‚Äî Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset ‚Äî 128 GB",43.83,4.7,"Llevo 1 a√±o con el producto y me encantan mis meta quest 2. Realmente tener un producto que tenga una dimensi√≥n como experiencia es fascinante, y m√°s a√∫n pensando que es algo que puedes tener en tu rec√°mara y en formato stand alone. Es una pena que poca gente conozca y tenga un dispositivo de estos. Espero que ahora con el anuncio de Apple la gente se anime a comprar dispositivos de realidad virtual /mixta, sobre todo de meta, ya que el dispositivo tiene un precio bastante accesible por una tecnolog√≠a realmente maravillosa. Definitivamente comprar√© los meta quest 3 en cuanto salgan y animo a las personas a adquirir una experiencia de estas, no se arrepentir√°n.Cosas que podr√≠an cambiar en un futuro:1. la visi√≥n.Aunque es buena, a√∫n es borrosa y a veces poco clara. Estuve probando y las im√°genes dejan de distinguirse con claridad a una distancia de 40 a 60 metros, que es bastante, despu√©s de eso las im√°genes se tornan borrosas y dif√≠ciles de ver. Claro que todo se puede hacer: ver pel√≠culas, videos, jugar, descansar, etc. La visi√≥n no es impedimento de nada, solo podr√≠a mejorar bastante. Est√° caracter√≠stica definitivamente mejora en las quest pro 2 y muy posiblemente en las meta quest 3 cuando salgan.2. La correa: la correa es muy inc√≥moda. Ajustarla para diferentes personas es tedioso adem√°s de que es inc√≥moda en largos periodos de uso y resbala bastante sobre la cabeza. Ocurre que si no est√° muy apretada a la cabeza (lo cual es muy inc√≥modo), al momento de girar los visores resbalan. La soluci√≥n es comprar otra correa m√°s c√≥moda, aunque al principio si te quedas sin dinero por la adquisici√≥n tendr√°s que aguantar un rato con esa correa.3. Precio de la tienda: los juegos dentro de la tienda de oculus pueden llegar a ser 2 veces m√°s caros que en Steam por ejemplo. Se entiende porque est√°n optimizados para un dispositivo stand alone. No obstante, a veces este precio de verdad puede llegar a estar muy inflado, tanto que podr√≠as preferir comprar la versi√≥n de PC y sacrificar un poquito el movimiento libre con un cable tipo c que se conecte a tu PC. Cabe recalcar que el dispositivo cuenta con un sistema que permite la conexi√≥n v√≠a WIFI con tu computadora para poder acceder a los juegos de PC sin cable, lo √∫nico que necesitas es tener una muy buena conexi√≥n dedicada √∫nicamente para los visores.  En mi caso prefer√≠ conectarlo con cable para tener menos lag.4. Calor. Despu√©s de un uso de aproximadamente 30 - 40 minutos, tal vez un poco m√°s (dependiendo de la aplicaci√≥n que se est√© usando) el dispositivo puede llegar a calentarse haciendo que realmente sudes adentro de los visores. En climas m√°s fr√≠os esto no es problema, pero si vives en un lugar c√°lido podr√≠a llegar a ser bastante inc√≥modo.En resumen, las meta quest 2 han Sido unos visores que han cumplido, satisfecho e incluso superado por mucho lo que esperaba del producto. Es una experiencia completa cada vez que  te los pones. Siempre es la misma emoci√≥n que sientes la primera vez que los usas y m√°s si te aventuras a probar experiencias de diferentes g√©neros: terror, aventura, sci fi, etc.Tambi√©n ha Sido una gran herramienta de visualizaci√≥n para cosas de trabajo. Por lo que, las meta quest son m√°s que una consola, son una herramienta para aquellos que quieran usarlas para este enfoque.Recomiendo ampliamente la adquisici√≥n de unos visores.

"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, supports Wi-Fi 6E, free & live TV without cable or satellite",43.83,4.6,"UPDATE 6 WEEKS LATER:Amazon has made some noteworthy improvements with subsequent software updates.Ambient Experience: It's still a bit laggy - Amazon has more optimizing work to be done here. But it's not nearly as bad. Also, originally the Ambient Experience always shut off after only 14 minutes and there was no option to change that; but Amazon has added options to set a longer timeout, including up to several hours or ""never."" The AE isn't perfect, but it's much better now.Permissions: Amazon added in the Manage All Files permission with the 8.1.0.1 firmware update, and it works correctly. They could do a better job at documenting this - you have to know to go into settings and manually grant the permission, you can't do this in a pop-up permission request - but it does work, so that's an important fix. The other permission differences (like Nearby Devices) are, in fairness, only really for use with sideloaded apps for power users, so it's no surprise that Amazon hasn't added those into the interface.Some users had experienced that problem that sideloaded apps showed blank icons, but Amazon fixed that very quickly.There are still other minor glitches with Fire OS 8, but it's much more stable already, and working well for its primary purpose - streaming. I think the Max is shaping up to be a reasonable and much cheaper alternative to the Fire TV Cube now for those who don't need the hands-free voice and HDMI input. The Max is also much faster and with double the storage compared to the sluggish Chromecast with Google TV.A note on the remote control: unfortunately, after a few days the solid-feeling remote control loosened up. The upside is that the battery cover comes off more easily now. But the bad part is that the remote is now *very* creaky and feels so loose it's almost like it could come apart in your hand with ordinary usage. It doesn't, but it sure feels cheap.ORIGINAL REVIEW:For context, I've been using the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen as my primary streaming device for several months, after trying a number of Android TV devices and having problems with all of them. I got the new Fire Stick Max 2nd Gen to try out Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.It turns out that Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience are the problem here.The hardware is the best I've used in a streaming stick or dongle. Snappy and responsive overall, great wifi, plenty of storage. In fact, in browsing the UI and launching apps, the Max is not far behind the Cube, and wifi is every bit as good.But the Ambient Experience is a problem. It's a good idea, it looks nice, and it has lots of options. But those options are rather confusing. More importantly, the AE is disastrously laggy. When customizing, it'll lag long enough you'd think it didn't register a button press at all. When launching the AE, the screen goes completely blank for several seconds as if the TV was shut off, before very slowly loading the image and widgets. It needs a ton of optimizing before it's any good.And Fire OS 8 based on Android 11 is a problem here too. What's the same from Fire TV 7/Android 9 still works just fine, but some of what's changed is broken.Most notably, Android 10 and 11 introduced lots of permissions changes that required apps to be modified and users to adjust their settings. And Amazon seems to have totally missed out on that for Fire OS 8. The most obvious is storage permissions: in Fire OS 8, file managers and other apps that access storage like VLC - apps that are in the Amazon Appstore - are just completely broken, because there's no way in the UI to grant the new storage permissions. (Storage permission is listed in settings, but it doesn't work.) These changes were announced more than 4 years ago and were very widely discussed and reported on throughout the Android world, so there's no excuse for Amazon not to have addressed that in preparing Fire OS 8. (The permission can be granted at the command line using adb, but that is cumbersome and should not be needed just to let a file manager manage files.) There are other permissions issues, too, but storage is the glaring serious problem.Quick note on the remote: although it's the same buttons, size, and shape as the remote with the Cube, the build quality is quite different. The Cube remote feels really cheaply built and is creaky and slippery; the Max remote feels like good quality and doesn't creak. On the other hand, it's really difficult to open the battery cover on the Max remote.Amazon has done a good job with the hardware on the Max 2nd Gen. But they have a lot of work to do to optimize and fix bugs in Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.

"Amazon Fire TV Stick, HD, sharp picture quality, fast streaming, free & live TV, Alexa Voice Remote with TV controls",43.83,4.7,"My 6 year old Firestick stopped working recently. I checked Amazon for a newer model. I noticed Amazon had a special where if you return your old Firestick they will give a $3.00 gift card and once they receive it they give you 20% off the cost of a new Firestick. That sealed the deal for me and I bought this updated Firestick (Not 4k). It booted up right away and it showed that all my previous apps were stored in the cloud so I was able to redownload all my settings and apps just by clicking OK. This saved a lot of time with setup as I thought I would have to reinstall all my apps again. The new version is noticeably faster than the old model. The new remote has special keys to jump right to Prime and Netflix. One new feature which i really like is having the TV volume control on the Firestick remote. Overall I‚Äôm very satisfied and by using the 20% discount and $3.00 gift card from turning in my old (non-working) model,  it‚Äôs a bargain.

So for that effort in them wanting to help I give the company 5 stars. As for the product itself I give 3 stars because it picks up everything even a tree branch on a tree moving. I hate to see what will happen with my blink when a wind storm comes through. Last night it picked up a wolf coming through my yard. With Ring it only picked up people and packages which is what I want a video doorbell to do. I left Ring because of the price hike they did this year. They went from $30 to $49 a yr and I would have paid a small hike and counted it as inflation but that big of a hike and Im gone.I had made a negative feedback originally because I could not get my chime to work. Well I got a professional to come out and fix it and come to find out it was because I just mounted it to the wall and expected it to work but I did not know you also have to go through all the steps in the app to get the chime to work. When I went through all the steps it started working. I would like to get in touch with support again because I cant get the blink doorbell to work with my echo shows like my ring doorbell did

"Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa | Charcoal",43.83,4.7,"The Echo 4 is actually beyond my expectations. It is physically fairly heavy, the quality of manufacture and finish is good. There is a standard screw thread tripod socket on the bottom of the Echo 4 and the power cable is about 2 metres long. I have two Echo 4‚Äôs which I easily paired using the Alexa app on my iPhone into a stereo group with left and right channels. I was also able to choose several streaming programs, including Amazon Music (default) and Apple Music. You can also use TuneIn, Spotify and Deezer. The amount of bass is very impressive  and a bit heavy out of the box but you can adjust the bass, treble and midrange using the app or by asking Alexa. The communication ring light on the base of each unit is easily visible, it‚Äôs very ‚ÄòGort‚Äô in operation, especially in a darkened room. I had seen in some influencer reviews complaints about putting the ring on the bottom but it works well in this location.

"The Best in Beauty Delivered Monthly",43.83,4.2,"The Box is at its best when it contains general use skincare products, like face creams. But since you cannot specify particularities about your skin, its problems (dryness? oily? acne? sensitive?), or the same about your hair, or any of your features, or even basic things like skin tone and hair color, a good portion of the products will be useless to you.For instance, I got shipped root concealer spray in medium brown - which does not match my hair color or hair needs (I've got no roots to conceal!).I also got shipped various makeup products that are horrible against my coloring, and therefore useless to me. Trash.If you are going to share this between friends or family members, then it's probably better, as odds are at least one in the bunch will find a use for each item. But to me, it's been a lot of misses.Samples are small and the overall value does not feel like $100 each month. Maybe $40, at the most. It's still better than the $25 they charge, but not so much better considering how many of the products turn out to be wasted.

"Amazon Echo Pop | Full sound compact smart speaker with Alexa | Lavender Bloom",43.83,4.7,"I purchased the Amazon Echo Pop and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. Firstly, its compact size makes it perfect for any room in the house without taking up too much space. Despite its small footprint, the audio quality is excellent, delivering crisp and clear sound that fills the room.One minor downside, however, is the volume limit. While the audio quality is great, I found myself wishing for a bit more power in terms of volume, especially for larger rooms or outdoor use. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it's worth noting for those who like to crank up the tunes.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Amazon Echo Pop. Its combination of compact design and impressive audio quality makes it a great addition to any home, though some users may find the volume limitation to be a drawback. I would still highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and capable smart speaker.

"Amazon Echo Pop | Full sound compact smart speaker with Alexa | Lavender Bloom",43.83,4.7,"I purchased the Amazon Echo Pop and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. Firstly, its compact size makes it perfect for any room in the house without taking up too much space. Despite its small footprint, the audio quality is excellent, delivering crisp and clear sound that fills the room.One minor downside, however, is the volume limit. While the audio quality is great, I found myself wishing for a bit more power in terms of volume, especially for larger rooms or outdoor use. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it's worth noting for those who like to crank up the tunes.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Amazon Echo Pop. Its combination of compact design and impressive audio quality makes it a great addition to any home, though some users may find the volume limitation to be a drawback. I would still highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and capable smart speaker.

"GTPLAYER Gaming Chair, Computer Chair with Footrest and Lumbar Support, Height Adjustable Game Chair with 360¬∞-Swivel Seat and Headrest and for Office or Gaming (Faux Leather, Red)",43.83,4.4,"I have only two issues regarding this chair, one is price related and one is actually chair related (but minor):1. Shipping Cost: $30 for shipping is insane. It‚Äôs a big, heavy item, I get it. But I almost didn‚Äôt buy this chair because of the shipping costs, but it had good reviews, looked the way I wanted it to in the pics, and I had an extra coupon I applied to it.2. The footrest is great, BUT it is very hard to pull out. I like that because it means it‚Äôs not easy to accidentally push it with my feet, but it also means when I‚Äôm very tired and comfy and wish to adjust the footrest it is a PROCESS to get it to move.Overall though, this chair is great. I personally recommend having a second person to help you put it together (at least if you‚Äôre inexperienced like me) specifically to put the back on. It‚Äôs super comfy, I love the little pillow behind my head, and I love how I can lay down in it or sit up. It‚Äôs a little too tall for my desk even at its lowest, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in a college dorm üòÖ I definitely recommend this chair!

"The Best in Beauty Delivered Monthly",43.83,4.2,"The Box is at its best when it contains general use skincare products, like face creams. But since you cannot specify particularities about your skin, its problems (dryness? oily? acne? sensitive?), or the same about your hair, or any of your features, or even basic things like skin tone and hair color, a good portion of the products will be useless to you.For instance, I got shipped root concealer spray in medium brown - which does not match my hair color or hair needs (I've got no roots to conceal!).I also got shipped various makeup products that are horrible against my coloring, and therefore useless to me. Trash.If you are going to share this between friends or family members, then it's probably better, as odds are at least one in the bunch will find a use for each item. But to me, it's been a lot of misses.Samples are small and the overall value does not feel like $100 each month. Maybe $40, at the most. It's still better than the $25 they charge, but not so much better considering how many of the products turn out to be wasted.

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"I'm not the most tech savvy, so haven't set up a ton of the features an Echo could have and don't use it for much, but it's still becoming a very helpful assistant around the house. It understands voice very well, and has a clear shut off for both the camera and microphone separately, so you know when those are shut off for privacy concerns. When you ask, it will tell you what Amazon products are being delivered today, which is very helpful if you buy a lot online. You can thank your driver with it, check your order status, and ask many different questions. Vs the google hub, I get more useful answers out of the Echo when asking specific questions, like asking when 10 days later will be, etc. Whether you have an Amazon music account or not, you can get it to play stations you like, which I've ended up using a lot as it's more convenient than turning on the Bluetooth speakers, and sound quality is good. For listening to music, the Echo is more than good enough in both volume and quality. You can also do video calls, which is a very helpful feature, both if you have multiple Echos around the house, or if you have someone on a phone with the Alexa app. And of course you can set little reminders or timers, which have become a habit very quickly due to the convenience. I have mine set up between the living room and kitchen, where we can use it in both rooms, and it's a great time and hand saver. It was extremely easy to set up, and just works, without fuss or manual updates. Great home assistant, and I know it has a lot more features to explore if I can find the time to.

"Executive Office Chair Mid Back Swivel Computer Task, Ergonomic Leather-Padded Desk Seats with Lumbar Support,Armrests, Black",43.83,4.3,"Very nice chair. Just got it and put it together. Was quite easy until I got to the part to attach the back to the arms. That was a real battle. Finally, I loosened the arm screws quite a bit then was able to wrestle the back in place. I suggest leaving those arm screws and the back attachment ones loose, then make sure everything's settled in place. Tighten them up, each a little at a time until all are tight. There is nothing written, just pictures which are clear enough but I think there should be at least my suggestion about attaching the back.The chair looks really nice and it's comfortable. I don't use an office chair often, maybe an hour a day. As long as the height mechanism doesn't fail I'm fine with it. That's why I replaced an older one.I bought a light brown but it is a bit darker than I would like, but nbd.Also, on the pamphlet it says 110 kg which is about 240lbs.I will add I'm a 75 yo female who is pretty good at assembling things. The only issue was the struggle to place the back. Took a break and went back and did it.Update:. I wrote to the customer service address about how I couldn't move that knob in either direction and that the lever to raise and lower the seat is also supposed to move sideways to recline the back. The high school line drawings in their instruction pamphlet show what I was supposed to do. They wrote back to do exactly what I told them I couldn't do. There's a slot for the lever to move in, it is vertical. How it's supposed to go back and forth in that metal slot, I don't know. And I can't move that knob right or left or out to adjust.As it stands right now. I can't recline that back even one inch.So, I've changed my rating to 3 stars based on the problem and on their useless response.

Recently, though, it began acting a bit wonky and it was more than a challenge to get it set up again properly, as the software apparently changed a lot across time. Time for a new device.We got the refurbished 4th generation version of the Echo for half of what the new one cost. Like with other Amazon refurbished items, it was indistinguishable from a brand-new version and works just as well. We use it as an alarm, a white noise machine, an answer-machine, and an internet radio (especially for WMVY and WUMB). It works great, much better than the first-gen model ever did. It understands verbal commands much more easily, sounds considerably better, and looks a lot better, too. We like its round form better than the older tower model.Consider this a ringing endorsement of both the current Echo and Amazon's refurbished products program!

If you have an Insignia 55"" or smaller Fire Tv, this speaker has better quality sound than the stock internal speakers. (Buy IT) , I have three Fire TV's in the house, Two insignia and one of the QLED 65"" Fire TV's.Hookup is easy and it installs in minutes.You loose the sound bass and other controls on your TV, but volume can still be controlled by your factory Fire TV remote.The mini soundbar remote controls , Bluetooth input (from your phone or accessory), USB in, HDMI input (That I use) and other input features. Sound (bass and treble are controlled by one button on the mini soundbar remote) not your tv remote.Overall it is a fair price for average sound quality from this easy to use device. Places the sound out front of the TV instead of out the back - other than that it offers optional inputs for playing from phone or USB input and is not needed and not work the extra $$ for it.

"20 Pack Vacuum Storage Bags, Space Saver Bags (4 Jumbo/4 Large/4 Medium/4 Small/4 Roll) Compression for Comforters and Blankets, Sealer Clothes Storage, Hand Pump Included",43.83,4.3,"I have tried every vacuum, packed storage bag made, and I have finally found one that ACTUALLY works. (I don‚Äôt do very many reviews but when I see an outstanding product, I have to share!)  I ordered the box of 30. They hold everything from bathing suits to king size comforters! Comes with a travel (lightweight) manual pump. I prefer to use this rather than my getting out my vacuum and it works amazingly. I was able to store another half the quantity I did with other brands. They STAY deflated, that is key and the whole point to storage bags. If I have a negative, is that each bag does not come with its own zipper slide.(I received six, for 30  bags. Even the ones that had the suction mechanism on them need to have one of these in place or else air can tend to seep in over time. But really, that‚Äôs a minor issue and that holds true with every storage suction bag.I seriously can‚Äôt say enough good things about this quality product. BTW, they are heavy duty so if you have long fingernails, they won‚Äôt puncture the bags like a lot of their competitors do.You absolutely have nothing to lose trying these! If I could give them 10 stars I would have.

"Certified Refurbished Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | HD smart display with Alexa and 13 MP camera | Charcoal",43.83,4.6,"First, I love the Amazon Echo since Gen 1. I now use it to automate all of the Govee lights in my house. I got this ""Renewed"" Show at a great price and there is nothing that would have me think it wasn't brand new. It does everything I need and more, even allowing me to (sometimes) be able to look in on my cats when I am away. This is the one feature that bugs me as ir only works about half the time, hence the 4 star review. But everything else works fantastically and now all rooms in my house can allow me to do things without having to move or touch anything! Also, I feel the it should be noted that the sound is surprisingly good. Warm and rich.

"Certified Refurbished Echo (4th Gen) | With premium sound, smart home hub, and Alexa | Twilight Blue",43.83,4.6,"I bought the Amazon echo as a renewed (redurbished) item. It was half the cost of new so I figured I would give it a shot. If I did not like the appearance or had an issue I could always return it. I was very impressed when I opened the shipping box! It was packaged as if it were brand new. The only way you could tell that it was not was the sticker on the box. Sound quality is great, it looks brand new etc. I do not understand why people have a low opinion when it comes to renewed (redurbished) electronics....they go through a lot more testing before they are allowed to be sold and they come out as good as new if not better and are usually a lot cheaper. I would recommend.

"All Good People Here: A Novel",43.83,4.4,"I wanted to rate this higher. I was absolutely giving it four stars until the very last page. This book is very well written overall. It reads very quickly, clearly, and makes you want to keep going every time a chapter ends. There are lots of twists and most if not all of them make sense, some even made me want to start the book over so I could see how I missed some of the connections.The subject matter is dark. Very dark. This one is not for the faint of heart. There‚Äôs no real gore, but there‚Äôs violence involving children, especially near the very end, that won‚Äôt sit well with some people.Regardless of all of this, I was still enjoying it overall until it abruptly ended. The book answers most of the questions it asks but leaves such an important part of the plot unresolved that I can‚Äôt accept it as a reader. I hate open endings, personally. I‚Äôd rather not read a story at all if it doesn‚Äôt have a clear ending. Perhaps the author who typically works with true crime, was trying to take a page from reality where there aren‚Äôt necessarily happy endings, but this ending choice felt like a middle finger to the reader, and took away from what was overall a very solid novel.

"The Women: A Novel",43.83,4.8,"""The women had a story to tell, even if the world wasn't quite yet ready to hear it, and their story began with three simple words. - We were there""Enlightening, informative and a fitting tribute to the female service women and medical staff who served in Vietnam, but whose voice was never heard because ‚Äòno women were there‚Äô. Kristin Hannah is an author who always demonstrates the immense healing power through storytelling, where voices are no longer silent, and in this book ‚ÄòThe Women‚Äô, she has written a fabulous heartbreaking story and an eye opening account of events in Vietnam that conquers without coercion and agitates without exaggerating.The Plot - Many know something of the war in Vietnam, yet many like me knew little of the number of the women in service and the female medical staff who suffered, endured, and lived through that conflict. Frankie brings to life the role and treatment of women, who until later years were barely acknowledged despite the crucial role many played in the war. While the men were branded heroes, the country was dishonourably quiet about the role that their women played. Women who witnessed many of the same horrors, lost their lives, and endured injuries like many men but to American citizens ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt even there.This very human story of Frankie took us on a journey through this distressing period in history, and takes us through the decision to sign up, how her family relationships became strained with the decision, and then the impact on her because of her parent‚Äôs lack of support, particularly her fathers. Add to that the loss of the three men in Frankie's life, her brother and her two loves and her re-integration back into society and 'normal' life and we have one of the most memorable historical fiction books I have ever read.Review and Comments - 'The Women' is an exquisite novel that will leave imprints on your heart and in your mind a long time after reading, not just about the brutality of war and loss on both sides, but the treatment and deafening silence about the role the women played. The book has an abundance of great characters, particularly Frankie who was portrayed as a very human person. An incredible woman, strong, determined, and courageous with an enormous capacity for love and forgiveness, but who for years suffered from the effects of war and because she ‚Äòwas not there‚Äô never received the care and support needed to prevent PTSD.The storyline is superb, and the writing style is stunning. Historical fiction at its best as Kristin Hannah manages to hold a mirror up to society displaying themes of corruption, dishonour, loss, tragedy, PTSD, family relationships, and isolation as women and society struggled to contend and confront the very harsh reality of the story of ‚ÄòThe Women‚Äô in Vietnam. An awakening for many, then and now. An authentic account of an unforgotten and untold story. Sometimes brutal, sometimes beautiful. They were there.

"Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear",43.83,4.5,"Honestly, there's nothing revolutionary in this book as far as what Gilbert is saying. She hasn't found some magical new formula for unlocking your creativity. Instead, what she has done is create a dialog, as if you were sitting down to coffee with a friend and confessing that you really wanted to be creative but... Gilbert deals with the variety of things that could follow that ""but"", and she pulls apart each and every one.Will everyone appreciate this book? Probably not. Gilbert does slay some pretty sacred cows, including the notion of the ""tortured"" artist, but I think she makes a very compelling case for all the cows she slays. The bottom line of this book, really, is do you want to be a creative person because you want the sense of accomplishment and transcendence that creativity can inspire, or do you want to be a creative person because you're hoping to make millions and be lauded by the masses? If it's the second, Gilbert basically tells you that you need not apply, and I agree with her. Creativity may pay off monetarily or in the form of social approbation, or it may not, but if all you really want is to create, who cares? Gilbert holds up all the fears that commonly hold people back and says, ""So what?""While I'm not a religious person, I got where she was going by likening creativity to a sort of religious calling. As she says, she doesn't advocate for people moving out to a mountain and living a life of solitary devotion to creativity--unless that's your thing, in which case you should do it. Instead, she's advocating for creativity as a form of not just self-expression, but as a way for people to make something beautiful solely for the sake of making something beautiful. As she says, it's both essential and non-essential. At heart, I think that's what makes us human: that we create things that aren't necessary merely because we like the look of them, or the sound of them, or the taste of them, or the way they feel when we wear them. It's in the act of creating--even if our creation is bad or misunderstood or unloved--that we are able to get outside of our own heads for a bit. We can forget about our mundane worries and struggles and we can experience moments of pure joy.Not that she's saying that all this can come about without some fear and struggle and some sense of pain. What she advises is that we learn to live with these things without allowing them to control us. I know this seems simplistic, but she does such a great job of laying out how to avoid being controlled by your fears. What she's revealing here is that what holds most people back is themselves. What does it matter if people dismiss your creativity or think you're strange? The best kind of creativity, Gilbert says, is the kind that's done entirely because *you* want to do it, not because you're trying to appeal to the masses. The Big Magic, really, is experiencing the joys of creativity for yourself and not for some nebulous, unknown consumer market. If you're fortunate, the market may follow. If not, it won't. Either way, you'll have created something and will have the pride of knowing that it's yours. And when you're done, you'll let it loose, acknowledge that it may not be perfect, and go on to make something else. You can do all this with a sense of awe that you're doing something that fulfills a need deep within yourself. It won't feed you or clothe you or put a roof over your head (unless your creative outlet is something like farming or weaving or carpentry, in which case you may well fulfill some of these essential needs as well), but it will provide you with experiences that you can hoard like treasures, to be pulled out and admired and marveled at whenever you so desire.Reading this book was so good for me because it helped me to see how counterproductive some of the nagging voices in the back of my head are. It encouraged me to take creative leaps and to be philosophical when those leaps sometimes fail, as they inevitably will. Gilbert has helped me to see that, no matter what, I will always long for that creative outlet, so why bother denying it to myself? I can engage with it for the pure joy of engaging with it, and if anything else comes of it, great. If not, well, I'll have been living the life I want to live, and that really counts for more than anything else.

"Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents",43.83,4.8,"Having read Coates‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe Were Eight Years in Power‚Äù and Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o‚Äôs ‚ÄúGlobalectics‚Äù (see my reviews), I wanted to get a woman‚Äôs perspective on similar issues. When looking through recent titles along these lines, I came upon, sampled, and bought Wilkerson‚Äôs book. The initial narrative as well as her preliminary remarks comparing conditions in the US with those in India and WW II Germany provoked my curiosity as well as questions regarding inferences and conclusions she would draw. As with the previous books, I was again devastated by the compelling argument relating our American racial/class hierarchy and its explanatory power regarding recent events.Within the book, the author proceeds to make her case through an Introduction (‚ÄòA Man in the Crowd‚Äô), some 31 chapters broken into seven parts and an Epilogue (‚ÄòA World Without Caste‚Äô). The parts are as follows: (1) Toxins in the Permafrost and Heat Rising all Around; (2) The Arbitrary Construction of Human Divisions; (3) The Eight Pillars of Caste; (4) The Tentacles of Caste; (5) The Consequences of Caste; (6) Backlash; and (7) Awakening. There are also Dedication and Acknowledgement along with extensive Notes and Bibliography sections.Some of the parts that stood out for me began with the author‚Äôs framing of her study of caste. For instance, Wilkerson observes (at Location 233 in the Kindle version) that ‚ÄúThe election [in 2016] would set the United States on a course toward isolationism, tribalism, the walling in and protecting of one‚Äôs own, the worship of wealth and acquisition at the expense of others, even of the planet itself . . .‚Äù A little later (Location 276), she adds ‚ÄúThen the worst pandemic in more than a century brought humanity to a standstill.‚Äù Her attention turns to questions (Location 280-86) ‚ÄúWhat had happened to America? What could account for tens of millions . . . [to] ‚Äòvote against their own interests‚Äô. . .‚Äù  After indicating (Location 357) that ‚ÄúLike old houses, America has an unseen skeleton, a caste system that is as central to its operation . . .‚Äù along with its imposed racial and power dimensions, the author clarifies her quest across oceans for understanding and explanation (bringing to mind Weiner‚Äôs ‚ÄúSocrates Express‚Äù and Zakaria‚Äôs ‚ÄúTen Lessons for a Post Pandemic World‚Äù---see my reviews).Wilkerson goes back and forth in place and time between the US, India and Nazi Germany to explore the origins, character and insidious effects of such caste systems. For instance, she relates (Location 1158-59) that ‚ÄúBoth countries enacted a fretwork of laws to chain the lowliest group‚ÄîDalits in India and African-Americans in the United States‚Äîto the bottom, using terror and force to keep them there . . . ‚ÄòPerhaps only the Jews have as long a history of suffering from discrimination as the Dalits‚Äô. . .‚Äù In one of many examples later (Location 1213-14), the author describes that ‚ÄúIn the early stages of the Third Reich . . . Nazi bureaucrats met to weigh the options for imposing a rigid new hierarchy, one that would isolate Jewish people from Aryans now that the Nazis had taken control. . . [They studied] how the United States had managed to turn its racial hierarchy into rigid law yet retain such a sterling reputation on the world stage.‚ÄùWhile the book begins and finishes strong, there is much substantiating material in-between to go through to get to the many gems hidden within the text. For instance, Wilkerson indicates (in Location 4754-59) that ‚ÄúThe 2016 election became a remarkable blueprint of caste hierarchy in America, from highest to lowest status in a given group‚Äôs support of the Republican: White men voted for Trump at 62 percent. White women at 53 percent. Latino men at 32 percent. Latina women at 25 percent. African-American men at 13 percent, and black women at 4 percent . . . The Democratic vote went as follows: White men, 31 percent. White women, 43 percent. Latino men, 63 percent. Latina women, 69 percent. African-American men, 82 percent. [and] African-American women, supported the white female Democrat by 94 percent.‚Äù Even while such references and the author‚Äôs anecdotes are helpful, I find myself seeking other sources to help spell out minority women‚Äôs situation and perspective further for someone like me (e.g., see Angela Davis‚Äôs ‚ÄúWomen, Race, and Class‚Äù and other such works).As the author expresses the tremendous personal/societal cost and detrimental human impact of our caste system, she admits the limitations of a book such as hers and the challenges in resolving matters. However, her text is well worth reading and offers the possibility of awakening regarding these issues and pursing a vision for a better world. As she states in her conclusion (Location 5553-55), ‚ÄúIn a world without caste, being male or female, light or dark, immigrant or native-born, would have no bearing on what anyone was perceived as being capable of. . . we would all be invested in the well-being of others in our species if only for our own survival, and recognize that we are in need of one another more than we have been led to believe.‚Äù

"The Four Winds: A Novel",43.83,4.6,"When Elsa, who believes herself to be unattractive and useless in a family that treats her ""less than others"" finally gathers enough courage to sneak out of the house and see what it's like to go someplace other than church she meets a young man and gets pregnant. Her family forces her to marry the boy she doesn't really know.In time the successful wheat farming Martinelli family learns to love her and her children with acceptance and more love she has ever experienced.The Dust Bowl days and years begin near Dalhart, Texas causing hardship that worsens year after year. Elsa finally decides to go to California to start anew with her children after her son develops a lung condition.California is filling up with emigrants day by day. Work is almost nonexistent. Families live in squalor and disease. They are taken advantage of by the wealthy farmers.Eventually, Elsa and her children join others to protest the conditions. Many injuries and deaths occur from violence while continued illnesses, deprivation, and giving up take many lives.Having known families who experienced the dust bowl this book broke my heart and stole it at the same time. Kristin Hannah does her research and it always shows. I gave this book five stars because it is brutally honest with strong characters who think they're weak and poignant attention to emotional detail.

"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean Book 1)",43.83,4.8,"Esse livro foi recomenda√ß√£o, e eu amei cada minuto que passei lendo. Ele mistura v√°rios temas de outros livros que j√° conhecemos, mas a hist√≥ria √© muito viciante. Eu fiquei super ansiosa lendo, me peguei brigando com os personagens. A escrita √© meio adolescente e me incomoda um pouco a autora usar algumas palavras modernas, pois me tira da ambienta√ß√£o. √â uma leitura f√°cil e leve, li em dois dias, pois estava gripada e n√£o tinha o que fazer. Tirando alguns furos no enredo, eu fiquei meio brava que a protagonista √© tida como brilhante e a mais inteligente de todos, mas ela deixa passar umas coisas t√£o b√°sicas que n√£o faz sentido algum. Por exemplo, logo no in√≠cio do livro quando eles se conhecem Xaden j√° d√° a entender umas coisas que ela s√≥ tem uma epifania laaaaaaa na frente. √â frustrante!Enfim, terminei o segundo livro e agora t√¥ deprimida. Kkkk Fiquei uma hora no Reddit lendo teorias.

"All-new Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) with Blink Mini | Cloud Blue",43.83,4.5,"I'm not the most tech savvy, so haven't set up a ton of the features an Echo could have and don't use it for much, but it's still becoming a very helpful assistant around the house. It understands voice very well, and has a clear shut off for both the camera and microphone separately, so you know when those are shut off for privacy concerns. When you ask, it will tell you what Amazon products are being delivered today, which is very helpful if you buy a lot online. You can thank your driver with it, check your order status, and ask many different questions. Vs the google hub, I get more useful answers out of the Echo when asking specific questions, like asking when 10 days later will be, etc. Whether you have an Amazon music account or not, you can get it to play stations you like, which I've ended up using a lot as it's more convenient than turning on the Bluetooth speakers, and sound quality is good. For listening to music, the Echo is more than good enough in both volume and quality. You can also do video calls, which is a very helpful feature, both if you have multiple Echos around the house, or if you have someone on a phone with the Alexa app. And of course you can set little reminders or timers, which have become a habit very quickly due to the convenience. I have mine set up between the living room and kitchen, where we can use it in both rooms, and it's a great time and hand saver. It was extremely easy to set up, and just works, without fuss or manual updates. Great home assistant, and I know it has a lot more features to explore if I can find the time to.

"COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 3.38 fl.oz 100ml, Hydrating Serum for Face with Snail Secretion Filtrate for Dull Skin & Fine Lines, Korean Skincare",43.83,4.6,"I saw this product on an Instagram video by an Amazon influencer. I decided to give it a go. It is everything that she said it would be. It is hydrating it makes your skin feel wonderful. When you first put it on you should wait a few minutes for it to dry before putting any other moisturizer products on because it is a little bit tacky. I usually will put it on my face after I do my toner and my serum drop. I will then do something else for a few minutes before I put on anything else like a primer or if I decide to use a bit heavier of a moisturizer over it due to dry winter conditions where I live. It is definitely worth the hype and I would definitely give it a try. I didn't have any irritation and I have extremely sensitive skiin. Also, there is no scent which is nice. I did feel a little strange putting snail mucin on my face but I am now a true believer The stuff is awesome!

"Quest 2 ‚Äî Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset ‚Äî 128 GB",43.83,4.7,"## Pros:- Cheap, Meta is selling at this price probably at a loss to attract more people. 128GB for around 33-35k is a great price.- Relatively higher resolution compared to a non-existent competition in this price range.- The quality of sensors is top notch. The tracking is extremely accurate.- It's relatively lightweight and can run off battery which means no cables. Very convenient and definitely the future direction.## Areas for improvement:- The displays could use OLED for better blacks. Though using OLED will hurt longevity so this one gets a pass. Currently blacks are like gray and that is something you will notice if you look for it.- The resolution could use an improvement. Again, it's an extremely competitive resolution for the price, but since it's so close to your eyes, even this feels pixelated and low res. It's early VR tech so expect that to improve with time.- The battery life is barely 2 hours on a full charge depending on what you're viewing. It's reasonably good, but in the future we could be looking at more efficient devices.- There should be a OS level simulated way to rotate when sitting still. It's tedious to have to get up just to rotate to other side of a 360 degree video. Allow simulating that via controls or something on OS level.- The headset strap is not comfortable for long wearing sessions. I should not have to spend more money to get a better quality strap. Wearing this device is a primary function and you shouldn't have to buy an accessory to make it better, regardless of the price. Only possible con I an think of, but it gets a pass this time.- On a related note, as this tech gets better, I expect components to shrink and this to get lighter and sleeker.- Would be nice to not have to create a Facebook account for this, but let's be honest, that's why they're selling this at a loss. To collect more customers and collect your data to target ads at you. That's how they make money, by selling ads and services.- Remotely installing apps from mobile is a hit or a miss. Most times it doesn't start downloading and I have to manually trigger app downloads. I think it's a temporary bug which they can easily fix.## Other notes:- Use Firefox reality browser. Way better than default and support ad blocking, multiple window and is also far more convenient and reliable with Web XR experiences.- Give Oculus TV a try. It's like YouTube VR but the interface is much nicer and the recommendations are also extremely good.- You can cast your Oculus view to your phone. This is super convenient when showing this to a friend or family member. Just cast to your phone so that you have a sense of what your friend/family member is seeing and guide them accordingly.## Summary:Great stuff honestly. Making VR affordable (regardless of the intentions) also opens it up to more developers across the world and that will only help give us better VR experiences over time. Looking forward to develop some WebXR and native oculus experiences using this.

It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it's worth noting for those who like to crank up the tunes.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Amazon Echo Pop. Its combination of compact design and impressive audio quality makes it a great addition to any home, though some users may find the volume limitation to be a drawback. I would still highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and capable smart speaker.
