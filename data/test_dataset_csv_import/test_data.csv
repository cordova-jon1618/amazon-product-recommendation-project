Bride,13.48,4.5,"I just loved reading Bride! I’ve read 3 other Ali Hazelwood books, and am always uniquely challenged intellectually by her writing. This is something I grapple with and love throughout reading Hazelwood’s book.I was excited to read a new adventure of hers that is unlike her other books, bordering on the genre of Omegaverse and monster-romance. I love the idea of “fated mates,” but I was never a huge fan of arranged marriage tropes, so I was interested to see if I would like it.The main FMC, Misery, is witty with dry humor, and a bold personality that makes her overtly honest. We get the entire book from her perspective, so Misery’s character grows on you, as Hazelwood reveals her backstory. The MMC, Lowe, is not only a sexy, Alpha werewolf, but he also is a strong, intelligent man who is a duty-bound pack leader. The author builds and develops many other side characters in a way that makes them memorable, and important to drive the plot rather than a support for the main characters. This is something I really appreciate about all of her books, is the side characters always play a significant role in different plot points.Their relationship is a “he-falls-first” but the fmc doesn’t know it yet, similar to the plots of her other books. However, I find the relationship between Misery and Lowe develops uniquely in different circumstances due to the Vampire/Werewolf/Human dynamic and politics that drive the plot of the book. Lowe and Misery get to know each other, share playful and teasing banter, plus the tension build-up is oh, so satisfying.It is always an absolute pleasure to read Ali Hazelwood’s books, and there is a slight tease at the end for a sequel to this book, so I’ll be interested to see if there’s another…I really hope so! I would absolutely recommend this to others, and give it 5 stars for the reading experience, amazing characters, and stunning storytelling.

"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, 1)",13.38,4.5,"I have to admit that this book is probably not one that I would have immediately grabbed after reading the description, but after seeing glowing review after glowing review my curiosity was ignited, so I pre-ordered this one from amazon. I'm so glad that I listened to the reviewers and grabbed this one. What a treat to read!No summary of the plot that I could write would accurately show just how awesome this story is. There is action and mystery and the supernatural. There is a love story ... sort of. It's pretty subtle at this point in the story. This is a story of survival as well as a story of a society which is potentially at the dawn of a new age. This is the story of a girl who has gotten by in this life by taking care of herself and herself alone for the most part, but who finds herself letting her guard down enough to find friendship and companionship. There are so many things to like about this story. I think I'll boil all of it down to these things:Celaena Sardothien. What an amazing heroine for this series! She is so strong. So strong. She can kick just about everyone's tail at every turn. She is smart and athletic and cunning. She has a big heart, but she is not in any hurry to let anyone really see that. She finds joy and happiness in life despite all of the hardship and trial that has been thrown her way. I love her because even though she is strong and a capable fighter, she is also emotional and vulnerable at times. She doesn't have to be stoic to show her strength. There is still so much more to learn about her. I can't wait to see what future books in this series reveal about her and her destiny to help her oppressed people. Even she doesn't exactly know how she fits into any grand plans, but I'm excited to see how she moves into her new roles as the series continues. She is fun to read about.Chaol Westfall, Captain of the Royal Guards. Oh how I loved this character! Chaol is a no nonsense guard who doesn't let his guard down around Celaena because he recognizes her potential for violence and mischief. He sees her strength and her intelligence, and he knows that she would just as quickly slit his throat as anything in order to gain freedom if she could. He trains her diligently and seems to understand her more than anyone else. In the process he seems to grow attached to her, but he never really comes out and says anything. His actions show his feelings more than any words he utters. So many times I just willed him to say what he was feeling, but I'm not sure that even he knows exactly what he is feeling. He was a fascinating guy to read about. I want to know more about him in the future books as well.Prince Dorian. Yes, there is a love triangle in this book ... sort of. It's not really one I guess because Dorian is in love with Celaena, and Celaena sort of likes Dorian, but Chaol is there too. The only difference is that Chaol and Celaena don't ever really explore their feelings for one another, either to themselves or each other. So it's kind of a weak love triangle. Nevertheless, I have to say that I love the character of Dorian. My heart breaks for him in so many ways. It has to be hard to be the son of such a horrible king. But it seems as if Dorian is beginning to form his own path by the end of this book. There is still more to discover with this character. I just know that I love him with his love of books and his kindness toward Celaena. I have the feeling that he will play a pivotal role in the future of this society if things will ever work out to help the oppressed.The ideas of this book. There are so many interesting themes that are being thrown about in this novel. I think it was interesting to see the way that the government had tried to eliminate knowledge from the people by destroying books and history. Now that knowledge is being held by the king who could potentially use it against the people. But it seems as if those who are rebelling have kept some of that knowledge, and that will prevent the government from having power over them. Knowledge is definitely power in this world as well as our own I'd say. I think that the idea of freedom in this book is interesting as well. Freedom is a powerful motivation for Celaena, but it is something that Dorian seeks as well. So many people in this society are not truly free, and eventually they will need to make some tough choices to see what they will sacrifice to gain that freedom. There is still so much more to discover as this series progresses.The pacing of this book was wonderful. Not too fast, not too slow. I felt as if I was slowly unwrapping a Christmas package, layer by layer, slowing discovering the parts of the book that would come together to create such a detailed and layered story. I almost wish that I had waited to read this book until the next book in the series had been published because I want to know so much more. I have definitely discovered a new favorite, I think. Future books will determine whether this one becomes a classic for me that I will read over and over again, but for now I'd say that Throne of Glass is a wonderful beginning to a fascinating and engaging new series. Five stars!

"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",16.99,4.8,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.If I could I would rate it 6 stars!The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...You definitely should read this!

"Amazon Basics Padded Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Adjustable Height/Tilt, 360-Degree Swivel, 275 Pound Capacity, 24 x 24.2 x 34.8 Inches, Black",95.37,4.3,"I recently turned a spare bedroom into an office and needed a nice chair to go with my new desk.After comparing several different chairs from retail stores and several on Amazon I decided to order this one.My decided factor was ultimately the price. I do not work from home and just use my office a few days a week, a couple hours at a time so I didn't need a $200+ chair. I didn't want the mesh back and I like the fact that this one has the arms and it is super padded and comfortable to be a smaller chair.As far as size, my husband who is almost 200lb, could sit in it comfortably. Anyone 200lb+ or on the taller side, this chair is probably not the best choice. I also can't say how comfortable it would be if you WFH and use it multiple hours a day.Overall, I am super happy with my purchase and the quality of the chair. I also want to add that putting it together was pretty easy. Leave the arms loose until you get the back on then tighten everything up.

Burn After Writing (Celestial),7.32,4.6,"My 14yr old daughter asked for this book a couple mnths ago. She's in 9th grade and this is a popular book that she heard about. My daughter plays sports and is a sporty girl, but she also likes to get fixed up and be girly. She started High School this year at a new school with new friends, had to do the majority of school online, juggle two sports, and has her first boyfriend of almost 7mnths. With all of these new things going on at this time in her life, she thought this book would be fun to fill out and look back on, or burn! As did I.There are no actual matches, of course. It's just a flat picture that really does looks like a 3d match box. I knew it didn't come with any matches before ordering, which is probably good depending on who this is bought for, but I just thought I'd mention it. You can get this book in different colors. I know there's this pink, a blue, & a gray. Possibly other colors, but those are the ones I specifically seen when looking for this.I scrolled through this book/journal, and it seems like a fun book to fill out and possibly learn a little about yourself. I know the theme is to fill it out and dispose, but I think this would be a great treasure to save to look back on and reminisce, as well as to see how much you've learned, changed, or grown overtime. I think this would be fun for many different ages, and not just teenagers. It would be great to have for when you're traveling, bored, or just in the mood to do some soul searching. It would be fun to fill out with a group of friends even. I think this would be a positive gift for anyone, especially those who enjoy reading or writing. My daughter hasn't finished this yet, but she has started and is enjoying the experience. She's happy with the purchase, and does recommend this to others.

Burn After Writing (Pink),8.56,4.6,"My 14yr old daughter asked for this book a couple mnths ago. She's in 9th grade and this is a popular book that she heard about. My daughter plays sports and is a sporty girl, but she also likes to get fixed up and be girly. She started High School this year at a new school with new friends, had to do the majority of school online, juggle two sports, and has her first boyfriend of almost 7mnths. With all of these new things going on at this time in her life, she thought this book would be fun to fill out and look back on, or burn! As did I.There are no actual matches, of course. It's just a flat picture that really does looks like a 3d match box. I knew it didn't come with any matches before ordering, which is probably good depending on who this is bought for, but I just thought I'd mention it. You can get this book in different colors. I know there's this pink, a blue, & a gray. Possibly other colors, but those are the ones I specifically seen when looking for this.I scrolled through this book/journal, and it seems like a fun book to fill out and possibly learn a little about yourself. I know the theme is to fill it out and dispose, but I think this would be a great treasure to save to look back on and reminisce, as well as to see how much you've learned, changed, or grown overtime. I think this would be fun for many different ages, and not just teenagers. It would be great to have for when you're traveling, bored, or just in the mood to do some soul searching. It would be fun to fill out with a group of friends even. I think this would be a positive gift for anyone, especially those who enjoy reading or writing. My daughter hasn't finished this yet, but she has started and is enjoying the experience. She's happy with the purchase, and does recommend this to others. I took a few pictures to help give you an idea of what to expect in person and to show you a few examples. I hope our experience and pictures helps you in some way.

Bride,13.48,4.5,"As someone who has been reading exclusively romantasy for the past year, I bought this book on a whim, knowing that I don’t particularly care for contemporary settings, but with the hype this book was getting on Instagram, I thought “a good book is a good book”. Coming from reading all of Sarah J Maas’ ACOTAR books, and Jennifer Armentrout, both writers who tend to be very descriptive even overly so, both in describing the environment and the characters’ internal monologue/thought process, the more “lean” style of writing in this book was different for me. The first third of the book was a bit boring for me, because I found the world building to be not enough, and that the writer chose to speed through or “skip forward” interactions that I would have liked to read through instead of being left to my own imagination. I would describe the beginning half as low stakes, chick lit.  I am someone who likes to read a detailed interaction between the main characters in a romance novel because I feel like that helps the emotions and tensions culminate to that sweet moment when they express their feelings for each other. In this book, I found myself having to “fill in the blanks” or use my own imagination a lot on how emotions were displayed. The writer says things like “I know he was happy”, and I found myself asking “how does she just know that? How exactly is he “radiating happiness” ? However, the last third to fourth of the book did come with lots of twists and high emotions which pleasantly surprised me and kept me hooked so that I ended up binge reading to finish it. And at the end, I could say I wanted more, and would buy a sequel if Ali Hazelwood decided to write one! I did appreciate how the main character was more even keeled than some other female main characters in romance novels who tend to come off as impulsive, stubborn to the point of being defiant just for the sake of being so and almost inconsiderate (immediately saying no when they are told or asked to do something by the love interest simply because “nobody tells me what to do” without thinking about why the person might be asking that of them). I found Misery to be mature in her emotional reactions and not impulsive or insecure. She can be quite flippant and casual in her dialogue even during serious moments, but this generally works in the book as part of her character as someone who isn’t afraid and doesn’t sweat the small or medium stuff. She does come off a bit as a “know it all” but her intelligence is supposed to be one of her strengths and she actually shows it with her dialogue, rather than us simply being told that the main character is intelligent even though she doesn’t exactly seem clever by any of her words or actions in the book.Overall, this was a pleasant quick read, and though the beginning required some dedication to plow through, the ending left me wishing for more! I thought the plot itself was fantastic and the conflicts were generally mature and not cliche and frustrating where two people could simply actually have a purposeful conversation and avoid a whole lot of drama (one of my major pet peeves but tends to be like a land mine in romance novel land). This book would have been a 5 for me if the world building was a bit more descriptive and emotions and perceptions were also described more thoroughly.

The Artist's Way Workbook,12.49,4.6,"I have struggled for more than 11 years to get through this book. (I know 100% I'm not the only one.)I bought the audio version and listened to it all the way through in a week. I got done, and felt so much better! I loved it!  Then I bought this workbook.I'm slowly working my way through the workbook. It's a bit challenging, but I'm pushing through, and definitely feeling so much more creative. My life is opening up in new & unexpected ways & I can't wait to see where I end up. I've got some doors starting to appear and I'm tentatively walking through some of them.  This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it to EVERYONE. Not just folks who think they are creative. I mean that - EVERYONE.When my husband and I were dating more than 11 years ago, he didn't know he was creative at all. I have worked him over the years just gently encouraging him. And now he is an artist! He is really exploring it (drawing a LOT on his iPad). I love his artwork!  And this book helped me encourage him over the years despite the fact that I hadn't read very far into it.He is actually the one who bought this for ME probably 12 years ago!!  He was the one with the vision. He is so supportive.

Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear,11.01,4.5,"“Are you considering being a creative person? Too late, you already are one,” Gilbert asserts. In Big Magic, living a creative life means living a life driven by curiosity over fear and this life is accessible to all who seek it. She breaks down creativity into five essential ingredients: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. Whether readers believe in a magical world or not, her description of ideas, why they choose us, and when and why they leave is inspiring to no end and her roadmap through the twists, turns, and potential pitfalls of creativity are applicable to all who dare to venture on their own creative journey.Gilbert tackles our biggest creative fears and inner demons head-on with delicious humor, wit, and grace. She allows fear a spacious spot in the car on our creative road trip, but never allows it to give us directions and certainly not take the driver’s seat. Time and again, she effectively and effortlessly silences our inner critic on such universal experiences as: worrying about what others think of us and our creations, bowing to perfectionism instead of completion, evaluating our art as low or high, as brilliant or a disaster, the struggle to declare ourselves worthy of living a creative life, the desire to be fearless or passionate when all we need is courage and curiosity, and much more. She also explores various paradoxes of creativity: the desire for permission and the fact that we never needed it to begin with, that creativity takes persistent hard work on our part and also moments of divine inspiration that come from something else entirely, that no creation is entirely original and yet authentic expressions are always original, and the ultimate paradox: that our creative expression must be the most important thing in the world and it also must not matter at all.Written in easy to digest, bite-size chapters, readers will feel as if they’re chatting over a glass of wine with their amusing and insightful bestie, Liz, as she masterfully weaves together numerous stories from her personal and professional life with hard-earned creative wisdom, always with an endearing self-awareness that at times borders on self-deprecation, and with a charm that is nearly flirtatious. The lessons are so powerful and relatable that if one were to learn this much about their creative life in a year of therapy, they could consider it a great investment. Big Magic ultimately provides readers with the necessary courage and inspiration to live bigger, happier, and more interesting lives, coaxing out of us our own unique hidden treasures.-- Lisa Blair, MA

"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 3)",22.88,4.8,"“When you erupt, girl, make sure it is felt across worlds.”I seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review. I'm going to try not to include any spoilers, but if there are any, I'll give you fair warning before reading further. Honestly, I am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book. I honestly don't know how SJM can top this book, but let's get real here...she will because she's just that amazing. I read this in one sitting overnight because I simply couldn't put it down. It's true, this book is a Court of Pain and Feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and I felt incomplete after finishing. SJM seriously took her writing to new heights, and I can't even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journey.“The great joy and honour of my life has been to know you. To call you my family. And I am grateful - more than I can possibly say - that I was given this time with you all.”I have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because I always felt that it showed Sarah J. Maas' extreme writing talent. It's so different from the Throne of Glass series, and I loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story. You can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her, and every scene is richly described. Her writing truly sweeps you away and it's something that you easily lose yourself in. I know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into Feyre's world, I would not even hesitate. This story is complex and I never expected for SJM to build on the world so much more than previously, but she does, and it's excellent. There is a great progression to the story, and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characters.“What we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength.”The book starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While some people might have found this part slow, I think it showcased just how far Feyre has come as a character. The strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her (and Rhysand's) plot was utterly fantastic! I think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us Feyre's mindset at the time. I definitely got some Aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass Feyre was, which just added to my love for her character. But the best thing: Feyre's characterization. I thought she was well-developed already, but SJM added yet another layer to her character. Feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book. Looking back, I can't even believe that this is the same person...and that is an excellent thing. It shows how much Rhys and the Night Court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately become.“I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.”Rhys is as perfect as ever. I mean come on...who doesn't love him?! The way he treats Feyre made me swoon every darn time, and she is his High Lady in every single way. He gives her something that Tamlin never did...respect. He believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing. He allows her to spread her wings (<-- this is an excellent pun btw...I know I'm really not as funny as I think) and embrace her magic. The constant support and love Rhys shows her is something every girl should have. Plus, he's freaking hilarious...you can't get a better man! I honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top 5 book boyfriends. Obviously the chemistry between Feyre and Rhys is off the charts, and all the sex scenes are perfectly written. I love them together so much, it just makes my heart happy.“It's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.”Cassian and Nesta are brilliant and I firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books. I need them together, and I need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story! They have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book. We learn more about Mor, and my heart broke for her multiple times. I just wanted to give her a giant hug, but I loved delving deeper into her character. Azriel is brooding as ever, but I love him. There is definitely something up with him and Elain, and I need to know what that something is. Amren's sass is pure gold and I love her so much. There are definitely some surprises with her character that left me (along with the characters) shocked. We also meet a new High Lord, Helion and god do I love him! He has to be in these next 3 books because he's awesome. We also see the return of the Bone Carver and the Suriel. And seriously...they play epic roles in the story. And Tamlin...I have to mention this guy. I actually liked how SJM handled him in this book (especially at the end). It was realistic and believable. And (Lord help me), I didn't hate him anymore.“My rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.”My favorite part about this book though (besides all the other stuff) is its unpredictability. Seriously, SJM gave me a heart attack multiple times. Just when I thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story. And there was not 1, not 2, but 3 major things at the end in which I was freaking out and making very weird noises that I'm sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate. The one MAJOR (and I mean MAJOR) thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock. I seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life, and I was praying so hard that SJM didn't do what she did. I think I stopped breathing at one point, so HOW DARE YOU SARAH J MAAS!! HOW DARE YOU SCARE ME LIKE THAT!“It is a new world, and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anew.”If you couldn't tell, I LOVED this book! I still am not okay after reading the entire battle since SJM made me lose my mind, but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything I could want. Most of the main questions were answered, but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing. I think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters' perspectives, but I'm never going to mind more Feyre and Rhys. This is by far the best read of 2017, and you need to read it as soon as humanly possible!Happy reading :)

"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, 1)",13.38,4.5,"Throne of Glass is the first novel in a series of 7 books (with the newest one being released in October 2018). Throne of Glass was actually my least favorite of all of the book in this series. As Cait from A Page with a View said in her Goodreads review, TOG is just not the strongest book in the series. That being said, I do think it’s a great introductory book. And it was enough to get me into the series in general, which is what I really needed.I have finished all of the released books, at this point. Sorry, guys, no I could not stop in between and review them. I had to devour them. Because “holy gods” this series is amazing.I know some people dislike Sarah J. Maas’s writing style, but I really like her books. In her newer books especially, (Tower of Dawn, etc.) I feel like her writing is able to convey the thoughts and feelings and reactions of the characters in a really relatable, personal way, without having to be like “Blah blah blah,” thought Celaena. And if you are familiar with Maas’s other series, A Court of Thorns and Roses, there are some lines that are word-for-word the same, which is kind of like a little fangirl easter egg hunt.One of my favorite things about Celaena is that she is a dangerous assassin, she’s strong and wicked and deadly.. and yet she’s totally sarcastic at times, girlish and feminine and frivolous. I love that Sarah J. Maas wrote a character is who is a complete bad ass, who also likes to look cute and go shopping and wear pretty dresses. Yes! In real life, women are complex and have many different interests simultaneous.That being said, my god, Celaena can get on my nerves sometimes. I try to remember that the girl is only seventeen, despite everything she’s been through, and is allowed to be more than a tad immature. I have this issue with many YA fantasy books, but I think it might just be me showing my age.But in general, I think Celaena is a rather likeable main character. She’s not dainty. Definitely not one of the heroines waiting for a man to save her, or even waiting for a man to train her. She’s bad all by her damn self. And she’s full of mystery and secrets. You never know what is up her sleeve, or what she’s hiding, which makes for a lot of excitement.I feel like I don’t even need to mention this, but of course I will, because I can’t not. The world building in this book is amazing. Sarah J. Maas is the undisputed queen of worlds in my eyes. I love both of the worlds that she’s created (that I know of). The TOG world is so rich with history, complexity, and conflict. There is so much that we learn and so much that we don’t in this book. I want SJM to write endless stories taking place in this world.The “King’s Champion” plot was actually one of the weaker aspects of the book for me. I actually thought it kind of lame. And a bit unbelievable. But anyway, I think that the main plot of the book was rather flimsy.The pacing of the book was slow in the beginning but it picked up after a while. And the twists weren’t too obvious either, I was surprised once everything was revealed (as much as they are revealed in this book). It’s definitely a great read and I can see why it has such a large fandom.Final ThoughtsThis series is shaping up so well! The first book is definitely enough to get you hooked but you MUST keep going. It gets so much better. Like I said above, Throne of Glass is easily the weakest book in the series, and if you even liked it somewhat, keep going because it gets a thousand times better.

"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, 1)",16.99,4.8,"10/5 starsThe world building, pace of the story, and characters were all amazing. Moments of hilarity in between moments of plot. I loved the characters and how they developed. I wanted to root for Dain and hope I was wrong, but he just pissed me off as the book carried on. I had serious rage levels every time he would try to step in to protect Violet or opened his mouth.I have been so invested in a story in such a long time, but this book gripped me by the shoulders and yanked me inside. Violet and Xaden‘s story developed in a way that I could see happening, but not anticipate how it would go. Finish the story in a day and a half, because I couldn’t put it down!If you’d like to read a story that has amazing world building, dragons, magic, a heroine who stands up for herself, and an amazing plot  - READ THIS BOOK.And the end! I am relieved that “Iron Flame” is out and I don’t have to wait for it. I will definitely be reading that next!

Bride,13.48,4.5,"I get the hype. Y’all. This book is good. Honestly, fantastic. I really enjoyed reading this one. I’ve enjoyed Ali Hazelwood’s other works, but this really may be my favorite. This story is hilarious, steamy, and just so entertaining.Bride is a paranormal fantasy/shifter romance mixed in with a mystery. Our fmc is a vampire and mmc a werewolf. A true enemies to lovers type situation, but as we all know, the heart wants what the heart wants. The chemistry between these characters was freaking fantastic. They were written very well and the romance was literally polarizing. The independent journey of discovery that our mc goes through was really really good too.Also, this world is SO interesting and I can forsee Ali Hazelwood doing a lot with it. The side characters were super intriguing and I see a lot of potential for an interconnected series. I love that Ali stayed true to her STEM vibes in this story as well. Though this is her first fantasy, I think she did a stellar job and still made it her own.So anyways, if y’all are looking for a fantasy romance featuring:✨ Enemies to Lovers✨ Slow Burn 🌶️✨ Fated Mates✨ Found Family✨ Arranged Marriage✨ Paranormal Elements✨ & a MYSTERYThen I promise, this is the one for you ✌🏻

You are taught how to activate those perceptual centers and get out of your head from those over analytical racing thoughts that run through our minds til your mind focuses what is right in front of you regardless of how you feel about it.It takes you away from ambiguity and paradox to what is.It teaches you how to concentrate on hand and eye moments and to note the nameless shapes and curves rather than the preconceived bias of notions of shapes that affect your ability to replicate.It shows you the psychological truths of how we work in an artistic way to develop perceptual thinking and reduce cognitive dissonance and why for thousands of years artists vs politicians have been that artists will paint what their mind sees no matter how ugly or awful it is or how beautiful or pleasant it is, they just pain what their mind directs them to. It teaches us how to access the deepest recesses of our subconscious til we let go. This is the brilliance of how she presented her drawing lessons.And in just weeks you will go from barely being able to draw to being able to at least do a somewhat realistic portrait although not full on hyperrealismIf you learn this book, it will then be a greater stepping stone to learning hyperrealism from elsewhere

The Artist's Way Starter Kit,21.49,4.8,"A friend suggested this book ... I am 66 years old and recently retired ... I am on a personal journey to discover my creative self in retirement ...  I am not a painter, or a musician, or any typical what a person would call 'artist'  But I am a creative thinker and now that I am out of over 40 years of Computer IT work I am searching for the creative self within.  I am just completing week one or a 12 week journey .. I am hooked ... It is amazing at how the reading and the daily 3-pages exercise is really helping me to cut right to the core.  If you are a blocked artist of any type.  Or a person that is looking for help to discover the creative artist within ... this might be a good read and personal growth opportunity.

Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear,11.01,4.5,"The ideas of this book are, of course, nothing new. But as Elizabeth actually puts it, it's her take on living a creative and joyful life. I've read similar ideas from other authors, with different backgrounds, all with their own spins, and I find this one very refreshing. It might seem at times that it's only focused on the creative ""arts"", but this applies to everything.I bought both the Kindle book and the audio since Iike alternating between them. However, the fact that it is narrated by Elizabeth herself made the whole thing much, much better!If anything, this books is a great reminder to not take things so seriously. Enjoy what you do. Stay active. Don't stop making things. Don't let inertia rob you of the precious time we have in this Earth. If you decide to read it, do so with an open mind, and use it to analyze yourself. I don't think anyone cares if you think

Good Days Start With Gratitude: A 52 Week Guide To Cultivate An Attitude Of Gratitude: Gratitude Journal,6.99,4.6,"I've wanted to keep a gratitude journal for a while, and finally started this year. I was picky about my journal since so many of them seem like gratitude worksheets and have you write down so much about your day, sometimes with a morning and night session. I knew I would never keep something like that up and I was determined to keep going with my journal and that's why I like this one. There's just three lines for each day for you to write a few things you're grateful for. It's one of the last things I do each day and it really helps me slow down and reflect on my day. Even on the days that I'm really tired or that were really long, I know that this journal will only take me a couple minutes to complete so I still sit down to do it. If I purchased one of the more intense gratitude journals, I think I would stop doing it on the first long day.TLDR: Great, simple journal! Especially for the price!! Super easy way to start focusing on gratitude.

I would give it a solid 4-star rating. The chair offers fantastic quality, especially considering its affordable price point.The chair's assembly was straightforward and hassle-free, taking me just a short amount of time to put it together. Once assembled, I was impressed by its sturdy construction and comfortable design. The cushioning is just right, providing a comfortable seating experience for extended periods.The swivel mechanism works smoothly, allowing me to easily move around and access different areas of my workspace.

Say You'll Be Mine: A Novel,13.15,4.2,"This book was an interesting romance that wasn't really a romance...or was it. It was based on families from India and I learned a lot about Indian food and customs. Both of the main characters were straddling the fence between being Indian and following their customs or being American which was made more difficult by two sets of parents who believed in things like arranged marriages and a strong work ethic.Meghna's parents wanted her to be an engineer - something that her mother continued to bring up every chance she got. Meghna wanted to be a teacher and eventually a playwright - professions that her parents didn't think highly of. When she finds out that her writing partner and best friend from college is engaged to be married, she is devastated. Seth never realized what a crush Meghna had on him but he continued to keep in touch with her over the years because she always had good suggestions about the songs he was writing. She decides that it's time to get on with her life and allows her parents to set up a meeting with a potential suitor - something that can lead to an arranged meeting. She's very unimpressed with Karthik who tells her that he has no intention of ever getting married but was letting his mom set up matchmaking meetings to make her happy. After they meet the first time, he calls her and asks her to go along with a fake engagement between the two of them. This will make his mother quit matchmaking and for her, she'll have a plus one for Seth's wedding. The more time they spend together, the more they begin to rely on each other. Is there a chance that the fake engagement will become real or will their initial impressions keep them apart?I really enjoyed this romance. Both Meghna and Karthik knew what they wanted out of life. She wanted Seth and a happily ever after and Karthik wanted to remain single after living through the kind of marriage that his parents had. Every time it seemed that they may be falling in love, a disagreement or a remark pushed them away from each other again. I loved the way their relationship evolved from strangers to lovers with lots of growth for both of them along the way.This is a debut novel by Naina Kumar and based on this novel I look forward to her future books.

Please note the workbook includes the same weekly questions as the book. It is merely giving you a way to journal your answers/thoughts. When I did the book years ago, I used a plain notebook. That worked just fine, BUT I like the workbook better. It is easier to see your answers, and note your own journey.The paper is newsprint. It is not fancy, very lightweight. I thought I would hate the feel, but I am okay as long as I use pencil, not pens. The paper is not lined. I liked this. One day, as I saw the shadow of my hand, I drew my hand. I would not have done this if the workbook had lines.

"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain: The Definitive, 4th Edition",15.51,4.7,"This book definitely deserves five stars! I've read it before and I didn't know it. Funny story: I had this book several years ago,  and I just assumed that this would be a recent version or edition. I don't have that book handy – the first one – because I have moved to a smaller place and it is in storage. So funny me - I bought the version I already had before so I could compare it with this supposed newer version? So I thought.  Well because the link didn't work to go to the Amazon page where  this book is located, and since I saw no reviews on what I thought was the older book's page, I now have three copies of the same book  ha ha. It's just as well because this book makes a perfect gift for anyone starting out in the art world. Drawing skills are a  essentials, and they come before anyone even thinks of doing any painting. I think that is why a book like this,  covering a method of drawing as with right brain and left brain to learn the basics and the tricks of drawing well, would be such a complicated book.  I've rarely seen a painting book that is this detailed.  I do have them, I would like to find them, because attention to detail – as with drawing and painting hands – is so  important and difficult to learn for the first time.I've been in and out of the art scene for over 25 years, and I am not what I would consider an artist. However, because of books like this, (and videos) I merrily walked into a watercolor class for the first time the other day and painted better than almost anyone in the class. It really surprised me. I took informal classes for six months about 3 years ago - at a YMCA where a member who is an artist and teacher decided to teach in a spare room.  She was really rude to me haha but I did learn some, just nothing like what I just painted.  I've only have the basics of training. Most of my expertise is in Photoshop. In Photoshop the are tools for perspective and symmetry. Just reading this book as a review has refreshed my memory about my drawing days. I think it is an important distinction to make that I am doing digital art most of the time anyway. Somehow, book and video learning in traditional drawing and painting has helped me translate skills into digital painting. Not so with digital painting books I have read where it is assumed you need to learn the software from the very beginning, but still assume you are already a painter.  Learning the drawing must come first, so I've been told.  Though I don't have any formal training in drawing or painting, and I've really studied about and practiced painting AND drawing at the same time, books such as this one are so handy to have so we can review the basics along with the added concept of left versus right brain thinking regarding drawing skills.So for me, it is more of a reference, and I highly recommend this book as a gift to a young person just starting out in the art world.  It is a precious classic for a reason. The techniques  are solid and classical. This book covers drawing from so many different perspectives that I find it hard to believe anyone would read this, practice with this book, and come away empty-handed. In fact, I would expect the best of results of course varying from person to person.Classical artists have been using most of these techniques for thousands of years. The right brain left brain drawing concept isn't new because this author has been writing updates and additions on this book for many years. I'd be surprised if many artists are not familiar with it.I get the feeling that this is an underutilized gem.  And I am happy to review it – again – ha ha :-).I have a new grandbaby, as my very mature son just had his first child. You can bet that she will get all of my art books. And her mother, already likes this one, because she gave a copy to me years ago. Instinctively, I was able to draw from the get-go, but to do it well – I have seen very few people accomplish that without some instruction. We are talking about perspective, composition, negative space,  positive space, drawing with grids, using pencils and other tools for measurement when doing what I would consider to be live drawing, and more. So many people these days use photos as reference; and even then, one can benefit from the good old grid.  There aren't too many projects in this book really, unless you decide that you want to practice after every lesson or chapter. This is the way to really get value here.I can still use this book right now, because in painting I am having trouble with foreshortening, which is drawing something at certain angles in perspective where the front needs to be drawn differently from the part farthest away, and you can only draw what you see as if it is the front of my hand in front of my other fingers and so on - as I understand it. I could never afford, nor could I manage a fine art degree,  but darn it, I am doing pretty well just the same.The reason why I am not explaining the left brain right brain concept. which is the cornerstone of this book, is because for me it is very confusing. I get dyslexia every time I try to think about the different brain hemispheres.  So please don't get me wrong; I am not discounting this sort of learning concept; I am simply saying that this book is just great on its own merits despite my not being able to understand the ""different from the norm"" concept within this particular classic.This book is very well diagramed, and much can be learned by looking at images/drawings; for example, a drawing of the ocean, showing how the ripples are smaller and closer together as they recede up to the horizon line;  just as when I am challenged with a landscape, it helps to know the relationship between one part and the other, since I didn't grow up observing so well how nature works.  Most artists I've talked to have been observing nature in a detailed and specific way most of their lives. This is not to say that no one will not be able to learn how to draw or paint really well instinctively, but it is rare.  I am saying this to demonstrate how important it is to know these concepts from a book like this to get familiar with them. Or to just be introduced to them.I am just as pleased to have a reunion with this book as I was to find that after three years of not painting with watercolor, I was able to do a landscape very well in watercolor when I didn't ever learn to before . Highly recommended.

I primarily bought it to learn calligraphy basics to write letters.  It gives a good description of the different tools, bands, and techniques. It offers four different fonts to practice with some room on each page to do so. Realistically, to practice further you will have to either buy lined paper or make it yourself. I do wish there were other fonts to choose from as these aren’t really my style. Most of the projects in here focus on hand lettering and not calligraphy, which is why I bought it. After learning a few strokes and letters I quickly moved on to writing letters for practice rather than doing any of the hand lettering projects included.

I had a mesh ergo chair for about 3 years, but the seat padding started to wear so needed a replacement.Assembly was about what you would expect from an office chair, anybody that has put an office chair together would have no problem with this one.  All bolts tightened without too much trouble.  Casters attached to the base firmly.  No issues at all with assembly.The seat padding has held up well and is just enough to stay comfortable yet firm on long work days.  The padded arm rests are still like new.  The back padding is soft and cool, no complaints.  It's not terribly ergonomic, but that really wasn't my primary purpose for buying the chair, needed something with good padding and durability.  Padding on arms, back, and seat has not faded at all.The pneumatic lever controls height, no problem with it staying at same height all the time (previous chairs of mine would creep up in height every few days and would have to re-adjust).  Tilt works as expected, allows for leaning back just enough but not enough to make you feel like you're falling backward!  Chair is on carpet and I don't use a chair mat...  Chair rolls easily on carpet.Overall, great chair and would buy again.

Say You'll Be Mine: A Novel,13.15,4.2,"This book is romance all the way!  Elementary teacher Meghna Raman’s Indian parents want their daughter to marry. Halfway across the country, New Yorker Karthik Murthy’s Indian mother wants her engineer son to marry. Neither family knows the other. Meghna is still in love with her college sweetheart who is soon to be married to the lovely Julie, a singer songwriter. Karthik has sworn off ever marrying because, above all else, he is fearful he will become cruel and domineering like his father. Karthik senses a rage boiling deep inside himself.Through the Indian-arranged-marriage-grapevine both Meghna and Karthik end up in Meghna’s parents home in a culturally rich meeting for their arranged marriage. Both Karthik and Meghna agree to fake an engagement for different reasons. For Karthik, an engagement will stop the multi weekly visits to different homes searching for the right girl and for Meghna, she would have her plus one for ex boyfriends’s wedding.As the fake engaged couple navigate family and social events and the wedding activities, their lack of communication drove me crazy. I wanted to pull my hair out! Just talk to each other!  But, then the excitement and sexual tension would be absent and we would be reading a short story.Sub plots of family concerns, job woes, and a few surprises work well in fleshing out the story. Overall, a predictable romance with the reader having a few pauses that just maybe the results might not be as easily predicted as thought. A three star read for me.

IMO it’s more important than the workbook. But if you want to stay on top of the assignments at the end of each chapter you need to get the workbook. It’s a very odd quality - the paper is kind of weird and the cover is oddly shaped (hard to explain with seeing it in person). Other than that, it’s super practical and useful.

Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear,11.01,4.5,"Honestly, there's nothing revolutionary in this book as far as what Gilbert is saying. She hasn't found some magical new formula for unlocking your creativity. Instead, what she has done is create a dialog, as if you were sitting down to coffee with a friend and confessing that you really wanted to be creative but... Gilbert deals with the variety of things that could follow that ""but"", and she pulls apart each and every one.Will everyone appreciate this book? Probably not. Gilbert does slay some pretty sacred cows, including the notion of the ""tortured"" artist, but I think she makes a very compelling case for all the cows she slays. The bottom line of this book, really, is do you want to be a creative person because you want the sense of accomplishment and transcendence that creativity can inspire, or do you want to be a creative person because you're hoping to make millions and be lauded by the masses? If it's the second, Gilbert basically tells you that you need not apply, and I agree with her. Creativity may pay off monetarily or in the form of social approbation, or it may not, but if all you really want is to create, who cares? Gilbert holds up all the fears that commonly hold people back and says, ""So what?""While I'm not a religious person, I got where she was going by likening creativity to a sort of religious calling. As she says, she doesn't advocate for people moving out to a mountain and living a life of solitary devotion to creativity--unless that's your thing, in which case you should do it. Instead, she's advocating for creativity as a form of not just self-expression, but as a way for people to make something beautiful solely for the sake of making something beautiful. As she says, it's both essential and non-essential. At heart, I think that's what makes us human: that we create things that aren't necessary merely because we like the look of them, or the sound of them, or the taste of them, or the way they feel when we wear them. It's in the act of creating--even if our creation is bad or misunderstood or unloved--that we are able to get outside of our own heads for a bit. We can forget about our mundane worries and struggles and we can experience moments of pure joy.Not that she's saying that all this can come about without some fear and struggle and some sense of pain. What she advises is that we learn to live with these things without allowing them to control us. I know this seems simplistic, but she does such a great job of laying out how to avoid being controlled by your fears. What she's revealing here is that what holds most people back is themselves. What does it matter if people dismiss your creativity or think you're strange? The best kind of creativity, Gilbert says, is the kind that's done entirely because *you* want to do it, not because you're trying to appeal to the masses. The Big Magic, really, is experiencing the joys of creativity for yourself and not for some nebulous, unknown consumer market. If you're fortunate, the market may follow. If not, it won't. Either way, you'll have created something and will have the pride of knowing that it's yours. And when you're done, you'll let it loose, acknowledge that it may not be perfect, and go on to make something else. You can do all this with a sense of awe that you're doing something that fulfills a need deep within yourself. It won't feed you or clothe you or put a roof over your head (unless your creative outlet is something like farming or weaving or carpentry, in which case you may well fulfill some of these essential needs as well), but it will provide you with experiences that you can hoard like treasures, to be pulled out and admired and marveled at whenever you so desire.Reading this book was so good for me because it helped me to see how counterproductive some of the nagging voices in the back of my head are. It encouraged me to take creative leaps and to be philosophical when those leaps sometimes fail, as they inevitably will. Gilbert has helped me to see that, no matter what, I will always long for that creative outlet, so why bother denying it to myself? I can engage with it for the pure joy of engaging with it, and if anything else comes of it, great. If not, well, I'll have been living the life I want to live, and that really counts for more than anything else.

Pretty Simple Lettering: A Step-by-Step Hand Lettering and Modern Calligraphy Workbook for Beginners (Premium Spiral-Bound Hardcover),19.99,4.6,"As a beginner coming into lettering knowing NOTHING about the skill, I was surprised with how quickly I was able to begin and pick up the letter formations. I love how the detailed guides walk you through what to do and expect. They reassure you that mistakes are expected and with practice and consistency, lettering will improve. I have really enjoyed the process of working through the book. I would highly recommend picking up a pack of practice paper (I found some at hobby lobby) if you are a perfectionist like me. I like to practice each letter until I can make it consistent each time and you may run out of practice space in the book.

"Amazon Basics Padded Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Adjustable Height/Tilt, 360-Degree Swivel, 275 Pound Capacity, 24 x 24.2 x 34.8 Inches, Black",95.37,4.3,"I'll admit that when I bought this chair I didn't even pay attention to the fact that it said ""AmazonBasics"" in the title.  But as it turns out, Amazing must have contracted some Chinese company to build them stuff in their name.  And as such, you can bet that the quailty of the item will actually be rather good.  Why would Amazon put their name on garbage?This chair is a fantastic value.  It was easy to put together, came with an Allen key and all if the hardware was in small, separate baggies that were labeled and the instructions were very well written and very easy to understand.  I had the chair together in under ten minutes while moving at a leisurely pace.  On top of this, the bolts came with blue thread locker already on them.  I know that isn't a huge deal to most people, but it means something to me.  It shows they want you to have this thing in one piece for a long time.The chair looks and feels like something you'd have in a professional office.  The faux leather is well made and quite comfortable.  The adjustment on it works very well and over all, the chair feels like it should cost much closer to the $100 mark.Make no mistake, this isnt some $300 chair, but at the same time, it isn't trying to be.  I basically bought this thing to sit in front of our computer that we almost never use.  So, in reality, I almost bought it just to complete my office.  So, if you have a home office and want a chair that's very comfortable, looks good but don't care about the lack of head rest and don't want to break the bank, this is the one.I actually work in front of a computer all day long, and this is a chair I wouldn't mind having there.  I'd probably miss the head rest after a bit, but this is something I would use in a professional setting.

"Amazon Basics Classic Puresoft PU Padded Mid-Back Office Computer Desk Chair with Armrest, 26""D x 23.75""W x 42""H, Black",95.73,4.2,"This chair is to replace an older chair that had simply worn out over a span of about 15 years of use. I was looking for a quick, budget minded replacement and then will spend probably weeks looking at a higher quality chair, with full high back. At this price, I was not expecting a high quality chair, and that is what I got. It is more or less easy to assemble. It can be a bit tricky when assembling the arm rest. I loosely attached the back two bolts, then the seat. I did the same on the other side, and then tightened them in sequence : Outer back and outer seat bolts, then inner back and inner seat screws. The threads on the back and seat frame are pre-machined but with very little tolerance so you need to be careful not strip them out if you start them at even just a slightly off-angle. Assembling the base and height adjustment assembly went much easier. The chair has a metal inner frame, and base is also metal (there is some wood on the inside sides of the back and perhaps inside the seat). There is some plastic in the base assembly, but that is only cosmetic. Armrest frames are plastic as well.  I also replaced the wheels with higher grade wheels I already had on hand (these have a slightly wider tread as well as slightly larger diameter). Finally I went back through and retightened all the screws, taking care not to overtighten. Assembly completion from opening the box to final check was about 30 minutes.The faux leather covering is what you would expect in a chair at this price range. The seat padding is very firm (too firm?) but not uncomfortable for me, but will have to see how it feels after a long session at my computer. The biggest disappointment is the nearly hollow back with NO filling or padding (this is where the parts are stored when shipped). Very little to no support! I had a large bag of batting I was going to use for another project in the near future but decided to stuff it into the back (the bottom has a zipper ... remember, this is where the parts were stored). I took care to install the batting evenly, taking care not to overstuff. It made a big difference.  The other disappointment was that, although listed as a mid-back chair, it is just barely that. Many other chairs (higher price) typically have at least a 24"" inside back length for a mid-size chair back, as measured from the top of the seat ... this one is 22"" The seat depth could have been maybe and inch deeper, as many chairs at this price have (this chair at 17.75"" is barely enough). I am 5'11"" and wight about 190 lbs. If you are taller or heavier, this chair might not work well for you. (My daughter, who is medium build at 5' 7"" thought it was comfortable for her). So here is my summary:PRO: Good price. Seems to be sturdy enough with full metal frame and base. Assembly a bit tricky but just need to be patient and have good lighting.CONS: Seat depth a bit too short. Back offers little to no support without some fill (DIY).So overall, this will do until I can spend some time to look at chairs in person, with better overall quality.

All Good People Here: A Novel,32.4,4.4,"Firm binding, easy to read lettering and a story you will never read again. Author neglected to write an ending. Incredibly frustrating read. Or lack thereof. I could have finished this with two sentences and one of two endings: someone lives or someone dies. I would have been fine with either ending but no ending at all?  That’s just lazy. Will never read or listen to anything this person “publishes” again.  It’s like going to a see raiders of the lost ark and they stop when they open the ark and leave it up to you to decide if anyone lives or dies after that.  Lazy and cruel way to waste a readers time. -5 stars for the author but the publisher did print a nice fire starter for a cold evening.

The Women: A Novel,32.4,4.8,"💭 Breathtaking, devastating and evocative, The Women was masterfully crafted and bursting at the seams with emotion. It's a novel that shifted my understanding and perspective and one that I will, without a doubt, never forget.📚 The Women✍ Kristin Hannah📖 Historical Fiction⭐5/5➡In 1965, idyllic Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath believes she can put her skills to good use and make the world a better place. Born into a family that idolizes war heroes, including her brother, she sees herself as a trailblazer when she enlists to serve in Vietnam as a nurse. Like so many of the troops she treats, Frankie is unprepared and overwhelmed by the mayhem and devastation of war, and startled by the new reality that she returns to.Frankie's story is told in the before, during and after of one woman's harrowing experience in Vietnam. Through the love, loss and loneliness that can only be associated with war, Hannah tells the unforgettable story of one woman but the tale of countless women whose dedication, service and sacrifice deserve the gratitude of a nation.◾🙏 Immense gratitude to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the advanced reader copy of The Women. All opinions are my own.🎯 What I loved: Wow. This book honestly blew me away. It typically takes me a while to get into historical fiction novels, and a bit more time to read but I could not put this down and devoured it in two days. Hannah's tremendous aptitude for humanizing tragedy on a personal level is unlike any writer I've ever experienced. Though going into a Kristin Hannah book I know I'm likely to have my heart broken, I feel like I always come out the other side with a different perspective and wisdom than I had going in. Without giving away any spoilers, I'll just say that this book was incredible. It moved me to tears, had me believing in the resiliency of the human spirit and broke me apart over and over.🙅‍♀️ What I didn't: This book was incredible but be prepared to cry.◾Read if you love:*emotional reads*historical fiction focused on the 1960s and 1970s*war fiction◾See also: The Nightingale, Home Front, The Alice Network

"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)",32.4,4.8,"A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015 - possibly even my number one. I have been (not-so-patiently) waiting on A Court of Mist and Fury literally since book one ended and obviously preordered a copy as soon as I could! Upon receiving it in the mail, I quickly started reading but didn't want to read it too quickly. This is one of those books you also want to savor! Especially knowing that I'll have to wait an entire year for the final book in the series. Before I jump into this review, let me say that I do not think Sarah J. Maas can do no wrong. I read the first two books in her Throne of Glass series before giving up on that one. But THIS series... In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection.This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyre's character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about (as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them).As I'm sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a ""team"" and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly #TeamRhysand at this point and I don't see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering that's what most YA fiction gravitates towards.I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be (although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat) and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses.One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury (and honestly, there are so many) was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas' beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. I'll admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page.And then there's the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As I've already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with - mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600+ pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didn't. There wasn't non-stop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldn't name anything that served only as filler.Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but I'm totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, it's not out of the question that they're probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think it's important to point out for those readers who perhaps don't want to read steamier scenes. (I'm sure you could easily skip past them.)As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling. I honestly cannot go on without becoming a total fangirl so instead I'll leave you with what I have dubbed Rhysand's theme song (you're welcome): [...]

"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 4)",32.4,4.3,"A Court of Frost and Starlight was exactly what it was advertised as: a fun, short, and festive novella about the Inner Circle celebrating the Winter Solstice and Feyre’s birthday. Besides the festivities, we get to see the characters rebuilding Prythian and supporting each other in the aftermath of the war. This book is everything that I was expecting and more. I specifically saved it to read during the winter, instead of when it published, like everyone else. I’m glad I made that decision because I can imagine Velaris during the holidays so vividly while experiencing the cold weather myself. ACOFAS is a lovely, sweet, and lighthearted story with holiday cheer. However, it still has a dark, melancholy feel to it because of the scars that the war left in its wake. It warms my heart to read about the Court of Dreams feeling happy, festive, relaxed, and peaceful. After the distress and heartache in ACOWAR, they deserved to have a happy holiday. Especially since every character is still dealing with the impact. It’s awesome to have new content about my favorite characters, even if it’s just a novella. I would’ve been disappointed if Feyre’s narrative finished with ACOWAR. It was a good ending but it was too open for me to be completely satisfied with it. I love ACOFAS so much and I’m so happy that Sarah J. Maas wrote this book!!——-Below, I mention what I love and dislike about ACOFAS, with specific spoilers and concluding thoughts. If you haven’t read ACOFAS and don’t want to be spoiled, do NOT read past this. If you want to be spoiled so you can decide to read this book, then be my guest. If you have read ACOFAS and are interested in hearing my opinions, then go ahead. Overall, thank you for reading my review!!______What I loved about ACOFAS:- The Inner Circle doing normal, fun things like shopping!! This isn’t something that’s seen often in a Fantasy world.- Multiple points of view!!! I enjoy reading books like this. Especially when there’s a large number of characters that I love. I want to know everyone’s thinking!! I think books written this way are more open minded, instead of viewing everything from one perspective.- CHAPTER 13. Feyre goes shopping with Elain in a weaver’s shop and asks about a tapestry. The weavers response about her grief and needing to create is powerful. This scene was so emotionally moving for me. I reacted the same way as Feyre while reading the chapter!!- Feyre beginning to paint again!! Also, her feeling weaver’s words in her heart and soul. I always love when characters have artistic hobbies. It was really motivating to see Feyre remember the Suriel and using those last words to make a change in Velaris. Feyre and Ressina (side character) starting free art therapy classes for children and parents was so inspiring!! I really enjoyed Feyre’s character in this book. The theme of using art to express emotions/trauma and to heal is the best part of this story!!- NESTA. I loved her character in ACOWAR and she was fabulous in that book. Although it was short, I’m glad that we got to read in her view. Nesta admitting that she feels nothing is sad, depressing, and concerning. I still love her character though. I like that Nesta has found somewhat of a friend in Amren. I strongly believe that Nesta deserves a happy ending! Yes, I’m extremely excited about the Nesta and Cassian spin-off book!!!- AMREN. She’s hilarious and such an entertaining character. Her reactions to the gifts she received is amazing. I love what Amren said about Nesta. I share the same thoughts about her. We got to see more of Amren & Varian, which I enjoyed.- ELAIN. She’s has a cute, kind, and gentle personality. It was nice to see her recovery from ACOWAR and busying herself with helping Nuala & Cerridwen. I can personally relate to Elain a lot in this book.- Feyre and Rhysand are relationship goals!! It’s so endearing the way that these cuties love and support each other through everything. I think everyone deserves a relationship like Rhys & Feyre!- The snowball fight Solstice tradition that Rhysand, Cassian, and Azriel do at the cabin. This Illyrian bat trio is so adorable!!- Rhysand, Feyre, Amren, Mor, Cassian, Azriel, Elain, even Nesta and Varian spending time together!! The Court of Dreams laughter and giving gifts. I live for the banter between them!! They are my favorite fictional group characters and ACOFAS made me love the Inner Circle even more.———-What I didn’t like about ACOFAS:- The wall scene. I wasn’t excited about it and I don’t care about this scene at all. I didn’t mind these scenes in the other books because they full length. It bothered me in ACOFAS because the book is shorter than the others. I’m over Maas sex scenes now though. Honestly, I would’ve preferred Azriel or Elain to get a chapter in their point of view than a full chapter about Feyre & Rhys making love (in such a short book).- Rhys going to the Spring Court and saying those negative things to Tamlin. I understand that Tamlin can’t be forgiven for his actions, but Rhysand’s words were unnecessary. As Lucien said: “Your mate should’ve known better than to kick a downed male” (page 165). However, I was relieved to see that Rhysand was self aware and knew he behaved poorly.- Elain and Azriel being the only two without a chapters in their points of view. I love their characters and I personally relate to them for different reasons. I really hope Sarah writes a spin-off book or novella to make up for this!!These dislikes are why I gave ACOFAS four stars instead of five.———ACOFAS didn’t really have much of a plot which I was completely fine with!! I was anticipating this because it’s just a novella to update us on the characters before the spin-off novels. For this reason, I can somewhat understand why the general consensus about ACOFAS is that it’s disappointing. Especially since most people in the book reading world read Fantasy books. ACOFAS is much more character oriented and not plot friendly. As I said above, I think this is something that’s not usually seen in a book set in a Fantasy world. I primarily read YA Contemporary books, so I’m accustomed to reading character oriented stories. ACOFAS didn’t disappoint me at all! What disappoints me is the mixed and negative comments about it. I wasn’t expecting so many low reviews for a Sarah J. Maas book because most of them well received. As usual, I have an unpopular opinion about a Sarah J. Maas book or character(s)!! In conclusion, I throughly enjoyed reading A Court of Frost of Starlight. I think it’s a wonderful, amazing, and positive story that’s worth reading, especially if you’re like me: a die hard ACOTAR fan. This book is now one of my favorites!!

"House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, 1)",32.4,4.7,"Writing this book after reading it for the third time and I truly can't rave about it enough.This book is so. much. fun. Such an indulgent read. It has such rich world-building and deeply human and complex characters.Growing up, urban fantasy was the only way I read fantasy books, so jumping into that kind of world again was so much fun. It is the perfect setting for a crime/murder mystery plot, which felt so original and refreshing compared to most fantasy books.The romance in this book is the most indulgent, comforting, reluctant-friends-to-lovers romance story I've ever read. Bryce and Hunt's relationship feels so authentic. I blush and get butterflies right alongside the characters.Every character is so unique and they all have so much depth. Reading about how they all grow and interact with each other is such a treat.Reading it after finishing House of Sky and Breath, it's incredible to see how much intention and planning went into this. I could talk about this book for hours.

"A Court of Mist and Fury (The Court of Thorns and Roses Series, Book 2)",32.4,4.8,"A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015 - possibly even my number one. I have been (not-so-patiently) waiting on A Court of Mist and Fury literally since book one ended and obviously preordered a copy as soon as I could! Upon receiving it in the mail, I quickly started reading but didn't want to read it too quickly. This is one of those books you also want to savor! Especially knowing that I'll have to wait an entire year for the final book in the series. Before I jump into this review, let me say that I do not think Sarah J. Maas can do no wrong. I read the first two books in her Throne of Glass series before giving up on that one. But THIS series... In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection.This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyre's character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about (as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them).As I'm sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a ""team"" and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly #TeamRhysand at this point and I don't see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering that's what most YA fiction gravitates towards.I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be (although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat) and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses.One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury (and honestly, there are so many) was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas' beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. I'll admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page.And then there's the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As I've already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with - mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600+ pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didn't. There wasn't non-stop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldn't name anything that served only as filler.Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but I'm totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, it's not out of the question that they're probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think it's important to point out for those readers who perhaps don't want to read steamier scenes. (I'm sure you could easily skip past them.)As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling. I honestly cannot go on without becoming a total fangirl so instead I'll leave you with what I have dubbed Rhysand's theme song (you're welcome): [...]

The Teacher,32.4,4.3,"...because I absolutely MUST keep reading!I've read nearly all of Freida's books and this is definitely one of the best. As usual, very cleverly done, well-written, engaging, and always with twists that make you wonder what happens after the book is over.The Teacher had several major shockers. I guessed 2 of them as possibilities, only because I knew there had to be some twists coming. But 2 others were totally unexpected!I normally only have time to read in the evenings, but I took time out today - when I was supposed to be working (from home) - because I just couldn't wait til tonight to finish it.That's something I never ever do. This book is THAT good!The only minor critique would be that, about halfway through when the story shifted, it accelerated rather quickly. It felt like it sort of jumped from a basic relationship to something more a little too quickly, and I'd have liked to have had a bit more insight into how that character felt about that development. But that's very minor.Freida did a fantastic job of telling the story from a teenager's point of view. She really nailed the language, thought processes, and temperament of a 16-yo-girl. The alternating points of view had different personalities and it was easy to tell which was which. This takes really good writing skills. So many authors just switch back and forth but all the characters sound the same; Not so here - the characters' voices were distinctive.Keep 'em coming, Freida!

The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles,32.4,4.5,"The cover of The War of Art has a quote by Esquire Magazine. It reads, “A vital gem… a kick in the ass.” Flip the book open and the reader will see the book is published by a firm called Black Irish Entertainment. It’s logo is a single boxing glove. While reading this book, I couldn’t help but constantly think back to this quote and image. Each chapter felt like a punch to the gut, a wake up call, a kick in the ass. Steven Pressfield titled his book The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles and he presents his readers with just that. A manual on fighting and defeating the opponent of life and resistance. I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for the tools necessary to overcome life’s greatest obstacles, develop yourself into an accomplished professional, and become the ultimate versions of yourself. Here's why:The book was first published in 2002 and written by Steven Pressfield. Pressfield is most known for his historical fiction but has also produced many award winning non-fiction works and screenplays. His first book, The Legend of Bagger Vance, was made into a reputable film in 1995. His writing often draws parallels between historical classics, religious archetypes, and motivational revelations about his struggles and others’. His tales have motivated multitudes of individuals to conquer their fears, reach their potential, and accomplish their dreams.The War of Art is split into three books. The first book is called Resistance: Defining the Enemy. He uses this chapter to call out what he believes as the root to most of our problems. He defines Resistance as “The enemy within” and a “Force of nature”. It’s a “repelling force. It’s negative”, “Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work”, and “Resistance aims to kill.” He says everyone has had a battle with Resistance and it’s the root to many of the issues we face and develop in our lives. Substance dependence, unhappiness, and anger are just some of the effects caused from our internal battle with this self-sabotage energy. Each chapter is poetically written to describe the way resistance can infiltrate our lives and destroy us from within. The goal of this chapter is to identify to readers Resistance’s characteristics so they can recognize and fight it when face to face with this malevolence.The second book is called Combating Resistance: Turning Pro. Pressfield uses the terms professional and amateur to describe the battle with Resistance. He explains that those defeated by Resistance think like amateurs, and professionals are equipped with the tools to overpower their Resistance and reach their potential. Some of these chapters describe a professional's attributes. They’re titled: A Professional is Patient, A Professional Acts in the Face of Fear, A Professional Reinvents Himself, etc. He uses stories and accounts of his own life and others, such as golfer Tiger Woods, to paint the picture of perseverance, focus, and strength. My favorite quote from this book comes from his chapter How to be Miserable. A marine himself, he briefly talks about how Marines are trained to love being miserable, to embrace the struggle, and fight to the death. The last line reads: “Because this is war, baby. And War is hell.”Book Three is called Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm. This chapter aims to harness the psychic powers needed to fight the Resistance he described earlier. He uses terms such as angels, demons, and muses, but offers his more secular audience the option to think of these forces as abstract and impersonal, such as gravity, instincts, or universal forces. He claims we need these allies if we are ever to defeat the enemy of Resistance. He mentions the Athenian Xenophon who would make sacrifices to the gods and call for their aid before any expedition. His own version of this he calls invoking the Muse, a Greek mythology term used to describe the nine Goddesses, or even a person or personified force used as a source of inspiration to artists. Additionally, Pressfield goes on to describe the difference between the Ego and Self. With quotes from famous psychologists such as Freud and Jung, he believes the Ego is where Resistance lies, while the Self is where the angles, or good forces, live. He describes the characteristics of the ego and how it is the “part of the psyche that believes in material existence” and nothing more. While the Self is our deepest being, united to God, and is ever-growing and ever-evolving. The Ego hates the Self, Pressfield writes, and is the perpetrator for growth, progression, and success. He goes on to describe what the Authentic self looks like, how to defeat the hierarchical orientation, and how to unleash the artist within us.As a young aspiring professional on the cusp of a career and “the rest of my life”, this book struck the deepest cord in me and immediately earned its place in my list of books to re-read every year. It’s an easy read and I read it cover to cover in about three hours. It’s organized like a manual, with short chapters, and important titles and messages that will resonate with you at different points in your life. While reading its entirety is do-able, one can just as easily flip through the chapters and meditate on the headline and chapter that speaks to you most. It makes for the ultimate bed-side book for any artists looking for daily motivation to break through their creative struggles. Pressfield also seemed to speak to me specifically. I have long been a lover of Greek mythology and culture, Xenophon, and the Bhagavad-Gita, all which he mentions and parallels in his chapters. I was also a fan of the spiritual take-aways in his third book. The War of Art is a self-help book, but differs to many I have read. It is straight to the point, raw, and hard-hitting. While many self-help books rely on abstract and vague themes, Pressfield tells his readers his truth with his own words, as blunt as possible. It’s entertaining, easy to read, and powerful to anyone seeking help.Typically, I try to stay away from definitive statements, such as “Everyone would enjoy or resonate with this book.” We are all individuals that react differently to everything. But I do firmly believe this book would provide everyone of it’s readers a piece of something they have been looking for. We are all artists, and without unlocking the creative power within us, we find ourselves riddled with dilemmas and obstacles that are far from conquerable. For all willing, this book will help you identify the enemy, equip you with the tools to fight, and unlock the mystical powers that will help you live a fulfilling life.

"Mother Night: Myths, Stories and Teachings for Learning to See in the Dark",32.4,4.5,"My mother passed on Women Who Run With the Wolves to me when I was in the dark stages of my teens, (about 15 years old).  My three sisters have also read these tales that might as well be true, considering how effective they are to real life. Together we read these magical stories that seemed to clear away the build-up of past hurts and painful experiences.Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes has this gift of healing through her poetic words and she is a universal mother that gives strength to all women who run, (and the men that run with us).I have purchased Mother Night on pure faith, knowing that this is the next step to being closer to that ineffable wild spirit that nurtures, heals, and protects, the wild spirit that Dr. Pinkola Estes channels. Somehow her deep-rooted, ancient wisdom reconnects the body/mind/soul.My love and gratitude to her and her work can only be described as a pure, wild heart.

She longs for a lover. And she poisons her competition. She clings to her brother, a mortal with the power of Gods. We feel her loneliness and her desire. She wants a lover.The author is a professor of classics. She decided to tell the story of the siege of Troy, the Trojan horse, the hero Achilles, and his powerful goddess mother.The author reimagines the gods and the warriors and the kings as being just like us: they lust, they envy, and they suffer.  Kings and Gods we feel should know better, go to war for the wrong reasons; they steal, and they lie. Yet their life loves, their heart pains, their infidelities, attachments and longings, tear our hearts too.  We root for them as we turn the page. We long for our heroes to prevail.  Our hearts bleed for Achilles’s mother. This is after all her son.  Achilles slaughters and kills. He has no reservations about what is needed to win a battle.  He glories in the deaths of his foes. But he like his mother also longs for love and fears the power of the gods.The author does not just tell us a story we will want to hear, she embellishes it with texture- nudity, shame, beauty, the touch of intimacy, the gore of killing, the size of the fleet, the weariness of slaughter and the colors of blood. Here is a story for all time told with deliberate pace. The climax will leave you shattered, surprised, and satisfied.I am hoping the author is already onto her third book. Her last two, of  which this is one, still resonate in my imagination.  You will never think of Circe, the legend of Achilles or the Trojan war in the same way.This is a book of wonder, magic, power, and love.  I highly recommend it.

"House of Earth and Blood: Crescent City, Book 1",32.4,4.7,"Writing this book after reading it for the third time and I truly can't rave about it enough.This book is so. much. fun. Such an indulgent read. It has such rich world-building and deeply human and complex characters.Growing up, urban fantasy was the only way I read fantasy books, so jumping into that kind of world again was so much fun. It is the perfect setting for a crime/murder mystery plot, which felt so original and refreshing compared to most fantasy books.The romance in this book is the most indulgent, comforting, reluctant-friends-to-lovers romance story I've ever read. Bryce and Hunt's relationship feels so authentic. I blush and get butterflies right alongside the characters.Every character is so unique and they all have so much depth. Reading about how they all grow and interact with each other is such a treat.Reading it after finishing House of Sky and Breath, it's incredible to see how much intention and planning went into this. I could talk about this book for hours.

Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,32.4,4.8,"This book was assigned as part of one of my Social Work classes and I cannot tell you how impactful this book was to me. It was a very emotional experience and gave me a true awareness of the tragic history of BIPOC in America. I'd always known numerous ways in which the government (and the various systems in place in society) had behaved toward BIPOC (Civil Rights Movement, Trail of Tears, among others), but the stories included in this incredible read provided even further context and heartbreaking details to give the complete picture of these travesties.

The Four Winds: A Novel,32.4,4.6,"I think Kristen Hanna is a good author, in general, but I think that this book was too  long, too drawn out, the suffering seemed to never end.. but of course, it wrapped up very nicely at the very end.I felt like I would never get to the end of it.It was very descriptive and no doubt very authentically historical. But I couldn’t wait to finish it and I only did because I needed to, Just because I had invested so much time in it. I did not expect it to get better, and it did not .It’s much like the classic grapes of wrath, but not nearly as well written.overall, I was disappointed. I feel like she had felt that she needed to write another book-  and this is what it was.

A Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 5),32.4,4.8,"Let’s get a few things straight before we do this. As much I was chomping on the bit to see what SJM does with Nesta’s multi faceted character, few things to remember.1. Nesta did a lot of crappy stuff, mainly in her early life pre Prythian, especially how she treated Feyre. And she continued a lot of that behavior later as well. Even with Cassian, who knew it was all for show but got hurt anyway. And I know post war, most of it is coming from her trauma.2. While I don’t begrudge her her trauma and her own process of healing, I also refuse to begrudge how the others feel towards her by this point; Elain and Feyre’s desperation in dealing with her, and Rhys’s resentment of, first how she treated his mate, and then how she behaved overall as part of his court, may all grate, but are all perfectly valid reactions. Because let’s face it, anti heroine or not, anyone would do the same, especially a territorial Fae male. As for Rhys being obnoxious to her, well they’re both alpha-h-o-l-e-s doing what alpha-h-o-l-e-s do, flawed and human (well, not human) and arrogant and that’s why we love them. Does it make them good or bad? No, just makes them family.3. I was firmly in the camp of Nesta being a superbly nuanced character who deserved redemption, and a proper meaty character arc. Not a hater at all, but not blind to her faults either. Girl needed to do some serious groveling before all was said and done.What SJM did do with Nesta’s character, is nothing short of wonderfully, breathtakingly GLORIOUS. The author is a master of crafting characters, but the ACOTAR series has so far seen mainly characters that are already fully developed, if complex. Except perhaps for Feyre, the Night court had already reached their potential as characters, being old and wise and all. But Nesta was prime for some growth. So gather round dear readers, for a masterclass is about to unfold. Never before has Nesta been more relatable than this book. I said what I said. Right from her tenuous mental health to her emotional constipation and self loathing and trust issues and lashing out, down to her weakness for romance, there’s something here for everyone. She is an onion, with her beautiful, complex layers that we finally get to unravel. Oh you’ll still probably want to strangle her a few times. But that’s the fun, innit. What you’re left with at the end is a flawed, real, MF-ing Queen.And what is better suited to Nesta’s steely flame than Cassian’s raging fire? They’re true opposites, yin and yang, and together they create fireworks. I’ve always adored Cassian, irreverent general and devoted best friend, but in this book? I don’t have the words to do him justice. Often underestimated and unfairly maligned, he’s a Prince among males, always there for everyone, and our beloved Illyrian warrior does swoon like nobody’s business. Must protect him at all costs. Nes don’t need no man, but he’s everything she could need if she wishes. Well aware he couldn’t be the one to heal her, but prepared to be there to help with every step of the healing anyway. How she hurt him made my heart ache, but how he loved her through everything anyway made my heart weep. Not that he didn’t do some hurting too, albeit inadvertently.Let’s talk about that romance y’all, the payoff of the books’ worth of simmering tension. Holy Cauldron, Mother, and all the Gods, SJM has been ~unleashed~ as an adult fantasy romance author, as she was born to do. The years of chemistry freaking exploded in this book, right off the page, the HEAT setting my body and soul on fire, with their dirty mouths and filthy activities (cue fogged up glasses). The training scenes alone are worth the price of admission. Their soul deep connection is a living, breathing thing consumes them, and you. I lived for their soft moments as much as their fire. While nothing can replace ACOMAF in my heart, I’d go so far as to say this is objectively her best work, and with the level of writing she’s produced in the past, that’s a mighty claim indeed. Inspiring, funny, emotional, sensual, epic, this book is ~everything~ I could’ve wished for.As always, we get some massively cinematic moments (see: training montage), tons of action, lots of humor, of course, apart from the top tier smut. Her handling of their messy, delicate family dynamic is so real it hit me right in the feels; both found families and blood ties woven beautifully through the narrative, including an unlikeliest of heart melting friendships. Heck, I could just read about the Bromance of the Illyrian trio forever. A plot point I would have typically deemed unnecessary is also very cleverly threaded into the story so as to make perfect sense. Unsurprisingly, I’m left an ugly crying, sobbing, emotional wreck, my heart in smithereens but full of joy and hope and anticipation. I don’t know where to go from here; all I can do now is curl into a ball and pray the wait for the next book goes quick.

A Court of Thorns and Roses eBook Bundle: A 5 Book Bundle,32.4,4.8,"If you like spicy romance novels and you like high fantasy novels, you will like this series. It is an adult series for adult themes and adult scenes, not just spice, but also gore/war/torture, and that is important to note. This series has its own magic system and mythologies, and is connected to other universes of the author including Crescent City and Throne of Glass but can be read on its own. I think it is a really good series.SPOILERS (not heavy spoilers but will talk about things which happen in the book in a general sense) for conversation about feminism/fascism/mental illness.Many people want a high fantasy series which is feminist in nature and the male love interests are feminist, this is not that kind of book. It definitely has feminist undertones and female empowerment undertones, it is written by a female author which historically high-fantasy books in a female lens have been shunned so I prefer to support female authors, but the love interest does many things which are not feminist.The male love interest in this book drugs her and dances inappropriately with her, and then claims there was no other way to make the villain think he didn’t care about the protagonist and put her in danger. That is pretty unbelievable, there are a million other options that do not include drugging someone in that situation.The male love interest “rescues” the protagonist and brings her to a place which only his friends and family, for hundreds of years of relational ties, are. This technically is a social isolation happening. This is apparent when 5 books later the love interest is not only still lying to the protagonist, but getting all the friends and family to lie for him about something that directly and drastically affects her life. She technically is supposed to be the same level of power that he is, but it is very clear that was a stunt to show symbolically how much he cared for her. Because if she truly had the same power as him then the friends and family would not have lied like that, the same way they would not have lied to him. The other thing about that is she was raised to her status without any well learned political or historical education of the people she is ruling, giving the male love interest good reason to be able to over-ride anything she put into place, and not giving her enough knowledge to truly do her job. What also goes along with this is that all education on those political historical topics will have to come through him or people whom he is employing/has these strong ties with.There is a race of people which the love interest rules over who are physically and sexually abusing females, and neglecting/abusing their male children to be warriors. The love interest claims to have put laws into place to prevent this, however, he does not enforce them. Similar to how he symbolically gave the protagonist a position of power, he seemed to have symbolically put a feminist law into place but then not follow through. It is claimed the abuse they are facing is culture, and to give the males more time to change, which is obviously untrue and harmful. “He will change” rhetoric harms women often. I think the way the fantasy race and issue of female violence was written was realistic, but I also think that realism is disturbing because of his unwillingness to be harsher in punishment towards males who are literally physically altering these females. It also is somewhat insinuated there is fascism going on because of his obsession with keeping one “good” city safe, and his distaste for the sexist race of warriors and the other city - which he oversees and is in charge of. It is almost like he believes their lives lost causes and something to be used to protect his favorite city and people, which is obviously harmful to the people who do not live in his favorite city because their ruler has abandoned them to harm in belief of culture.Again, this is a fantasy book, I do not believe this to reflect the authors beliefs on feminism or humanitarian efforts, but if you personally are looking for a high-fantasy book with a feminist love interest, this is probably not the one.Lastly, the last book has a topic of mental illness- specifically substance use issues. This book was so difficult to read as a researcher in psychology because of the abuse the protagonist faced and how she got better despite, in real life, this person would likely be far worse off. What I mean by this is the protagonist was unliked due to a disability she had in childhood, inadaptibility which is something that happens in children groomed to be married off (groomed meaning taught to be something very specific, particularly in a way of being sold to the highest bidder and marrying a wealthy male). Her sister took her meaning for life by marrying someone powerful and rich without any of the efforts and grooming which the protagonist faced in childhood, so all her trauma no longer had meaning and she no longer felt any reason to be alive. After this she developed an addiction to alcohol and began sexual risk taking behaviors. What her family did was ridicule and shame her but also enable her with money. Shame results in a cycle of wanting pleasure, so doing this was worsening her behavior. After the family got fed up with her wasting money, instead of setting boundaries and no longer buying alcohol, they threatened her life, took away her autonomy, verbally and emotionally abused her, isolated her, and then the person in charge of helping her developed a sexual relationship with her (which is supposed to be romantic but when she already struggled with risky sexual behaviors, this was taking advantage of her). On top it, a scene occurs where she essentially is noted as suicidal, and instead of helping her he continues to be short, rude, and mean to her and forced her to hike (???). And this was because she pointed out a lie which the whole family was keeping from her sister by her love interest, so the protagonist of this book was being punished for giving information which her sister had a right to know. It is just so incredibly hard to read.Of course, these people do not have psychology or mental wellness, however, I think the part I take most issue with is the unrealistic fact she gets better. Because this is a popular series I would also be concerned with people taking the idea that this sort of behavior towards someone mentally ill is romantic or okay in any way shape or form. This is fantasy, most people know that, but I feel compelled to state it anyway.  Overall:I do like the books, I like the writing style, I even do not mind many of the character flaws and the big issues I mentioned occurring, it adds to moral/ethical calamity and makes you question who is the real villain or hero. But, I have seen people stating that this is a more feminist style high fantasy romance and I just wanted to point all the reasons I do not believe that to be the case.

Fourth Wing (The Empyrean Book 1),32.4,4.8,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.If I could I would rate it 6 stars!The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...You definitely should read this!

NEO CHAIR Ergonomic Office Chair PU Leather Executive Chair Padded Flip Up Armrest Computer Chair Adjustable Height High Back Lumbar Support Wheels Swivel for Gaming Desk Chair (White),32.4,4.3,"Packaging: The chair is well packaged. All the parts were in the box. All of the hardware is labeled including a small pack containing extra pieces of hardware just inn case they are needed. The allen wrench has a T handle and is a step up from what I typically see. The seat and back come covered in plastic.Assembly: Overall the assembly is easy. The steps are in logical order starting with attaching the spider legs (my term) being attached to the center piece. At step 4 of the assembly the instructions show putting a cosmetic cover piece that hides the bolts that attach the legs to the center piece. This cover was not in the box. I reached out to the seller & they promptly responded. The assembly instructions in the box was a first addition.  There is a second addition that illuminates that step because the cover is no longer needed. They sent me an electronic version of the correct assembly instructions. I did notice during assembly that there didn’t seem to be a need for the cover because they design looks finished without the cover.Appearance: When assembled the chair looks nice. The feel of the material is nice. The finish of the back and seat were good. There were no issues with poor seams or sloppy sewing lines. It looks like they have a good level of quality control in place.Comfort: The chair feels nice with good lumbar support. I feel like it fits like a glove. However, I’m only 5’6” tall. I wouldn’t expect a taller person to have that kind of fit. The lumbar support is not adjustable. The chair will adjust in height and the recline function can be locked out.Overall I would recommend this chair as a good, no frills chair that’s comfortable. Time will tell if there are durability issues.

Twenty years later, grown up Margot returns to town to care for her uncle, Luke, who suffers from early onset dementia. Luke, who was always like a father to her. A man without kids of his own who had always wanted them.Just after her arrival in town, a young girl from a neighboring town goes missing and is soon found dead, in a manner similar to January’s death. And so Margot starts to poke around.

It fits the bill as a tight story. There are twists and turns, red herrings and hidden clues. Ultimately though, it didn’t stick the ending. The actual ending is fine, could be satisfying as far as tying up loose ends, but the culprit doesn’t fit. The person described in the flashback wasn’t described as so angry and heartless in the rest of the story. It feels out of character. If only a few more hints of that evil had been tossed into the earlier narrative, I would have felt better about the end.

Frankie McGrath, a young, naive, and coming of age woman from Coronado, CA.Frankie’s journey from the beaches of Coronado, CA to her following her brother into the military, her parents and her expectations, the training, her experiences in getting to Vietnam, earning the trust of her colleagues and medical professionals while serving, the camaraderie, the relationships, the realism of war and the lack of respect for serving when home will ALL ring true to any “In-Country” Vietnam veteran.Kristin Hannah’s style of writing, the riveting and realistic descriptions of the challenges of nursing in a combat zone and the idealism to be an Army nurse in the 1960’s are so authentic. Then, the intensity of Kristin Hannah’s “war stories” detailing the gritty service at the 36th Evac Hospital at Vung Tau and the 71st Evac Hospital in the Central Highlands in Pleiku are so realistic, so moving and so relatable.An example: “Outside, the whump-whump of the helicopters was defending. Frankie and Barb ran past the helipad, where the wounded were being offloaded from a Dust Off and coming in by ambulance. Men covered in mud and blood, working, shouting at one another beneath the womping rotors. In the air, a row of helicopters hovered, waited their turn to touch down” describing a mass casualty event for their medical team when helicopters were landing during a major enemy offensive.Parts of “The Women” read like Diane Carlson Evans memoir “Healing Wounds” and informed by Diane’s experiences as a U.S. Army nurse from service in the same areas of Vietnam. Diane Carlson Evans is the founder of the Vietnam Women’s Memorial at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC.“The Women” is very relatable to any Vietnam veteran who served at that time and anyone that lived thru the 1960’s-1970’s, especially women. “Women Can Be Heroes” and the Vietnam era continues to matter!-Bill Shugarts, Vietnam Veteran (1969-1970) 23rd Infantry Division-Americal, National Park Service Master Docent at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Church Military Ministry Leader, Fawn Lake Veterans Group Co-Founder.March 2024

"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)",32.4,4.8,"I seriously don't even know where to begin with this review because all I want to do is fangirl so hard over how much I ADORED this book! Seriously people...every single word, every single scene is so gorgeously written and breathtaking that I had to stop multiple times while I was reading just to admire and appreciate what I just read. This book was absolutely excellent on so many levels that no words can do it justice (but I'm going to try because this is a review after all haha). I don't think it's any secret that Sarah J. Maas is an amazeballs author, but in case you need a reminder, just read this book and you will see the supreme talent this woman has. She could write a phone book and I would read it because somehow even that would be an amazing read. I've only said this about 1 or 2 other authors, but it's completely true.“There are different kinds of darkness,” Rhys said. I kept my eyes shut. “There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”This book made me feel so many different things at once, and literally it has it ALL! There are amazing twists, snarky banter, beautiful writing, and just plain badass, awesome characters that you want to be best friends with. After finishing this book all I want to do is be in the Night Court and be apart of Rhysand's inner circle. It's probably unhealthy how badly I want this to happen right now. But even more, SJM wrote scenes bursting with heart-pounding action, swoonworthy romance (which be warned, will leaving you squeeing), and female empowerment...GAH! I NEVER wanted to stop reading. But you know what I loved the most? Even though this story is a romance, it is also a story of self-discovery.“I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless againI would not, could not be broken.”Feyre goes through so much and is incredibly strong. She is extremely relatable because even though she loses herself for a bit, she finds that inner fire that she once had and it causes a spark to ignite within her. She becomes even more amazing than her character was previously, and finds herself on her own. Feyre is such an admirable and relatable character. I mean who among us hasn't felt lost at one point or the other in their life?? Feyre shows everyone that you have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength to rise above and accept the past, and never let that thing that caused you to be lost define you. We need to embrace the pain and the anguish that came with the hand life has dealt, and choose to move forward in life...or we will remain lost. The character development for Feyre was seriously one of the best character development's I have ever read, and I think SJM deserves a HUGE round of applause for giving all readers this character. She becomes stronger and more determined than ever to accomplish what she has set out to do. All the while she remains the stubborn and sassy character we love.“I was not prey any longer, I decided as I eased up to that door.And I was not a mouse.I was a wolf.”Rhysand...literally I have no words for my love. My heart (and ovaries) were literally bursting with every word he said. He broke my heart multiple times, and there was one scene in particular where I was gross sobbing when he was revealing things to Feyre. He still remains that mysterious Dark Lord, but we are able to understand and see so much more of him than ever before. Like Feyre, Rhys grew so much in this novel, and I loved watching how he became a little less broken due to Feyre's presence in his life. Feyre provides a nice balance to Rhys, and they're banter is like no other. We all know how shameless a flirt Rhys is, but boy does he step it up in this book...and I loved every single second of it. He had me laughing so hard countless times, and I can't even tell you how much I love him.The world that SJM has created is simply phenomenal, and I seriously don't know how she came up with her ideas, but let's just thank whoever that she did. There is so much to this world that we didn't know, and I loved learning so many new things over the course of the book. We visit more courts and see different races. We see the political uneasiness that ultimately exists in this world, and how alliances can change at the drop of a hat. And then comes the ending...it is brutal and ripped my heart out, but it left me begging for more! For the entire conclusion I basically had my jaw permanently dropped and then my heart torn out because of the events that SJM wrote. But all I know is that I can't wait to see where she takes this series in the next book because there are truly endless possibilities!“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”If you couldn't tell already, you need to read this book as soon as possible because this is the best book of 2016 so far!Happy reading :)

"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 4)",32.4,4.3,"⭐️: 4.25/5🌶️: 2/5Ummmm am I an ACOFAS girly now??? All the sudden, this novella has become my favorite book in the series without me realizing it.This re-read, I took the time to critically analyze ACOFAS, and really started to understand just how important this book is to the series. In Frost and Starlight, we get our lodestone character development which, in my opinion, is the foundation for the next phase of the entire series. We get deeper looks internally at characters' struggles, all set within a simple, relatively positive setting of the solstice holiday. This contrast helps highlight the development occurring within each character so that it's the main focus.We also get a lot of foreshadowing. If you've read the next book in the series, ACOFAS tees up so much without us realizing it. I believe it actually sets up even more than we realize, given that books past ACOSF haven't yet been published.The spice was minimal, and okay. I rated it 2/5 just because there were multiple scenes, but they are relatively tame!I think this was such an enjoyable read because had brevity and levity, but we still got so many breadcrumbs, I was left satisfied. It's a great break in the series, and an absolutely critical read--don't skip it over!

"House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, 1)",32.4,4.7,"Being the fan of an author's work is both a blessing and a curse.  You count down the days until their next—usually hyped up—release is to be published.  You talk about it more and more the closer that said release day approaches.  You try to enter any possible pre-order special is available, in the hope of getting a lovely exclusive pin, or a poster, or a print.And then the book releases...I don't know about you, but once that book hits shelves, I am violently torn between a crazed eagerness to read it, and a nearly crippling fear that I am going to hate the book no matter how much I have loved this author's stories in the past.  Which, let's face it, is one of the worst things to happen in a reader's life.Thank you, Maas, for delivering the goods once again.House of Earth and Blood is not a perfect novel.  I'm not even sure that such a thing is possible, to be frank, because our love of books is a very personal thing.  But, this novel is a punch to the heart, in the best possible way.  I absolutely fell in love with the story, with the characters, with the world that was created.  And it is definitely a complex and intricate world of which we get a glimpse, but that is sure to open up to us even more, and I cannot wait to continue exploring it as the series progresses.I'm a huge fan of badass female leads in novels.  What can I say, I live vicariously through them.  Ironically, I usually don't like so-called “badass” female leads in novels, because most of the time what we're given are annoying females that try too hard.  I initially read the sample for HoEaB that NetGalley provided, and I was a bit unsure about Bryce.  She came off a tad strong for me, and I was instantly worried that this meant negativity throughout the rest of the novel.  Maybe my mindset was not in its proper place then, but I am so glad that I decided to read the full novel from the first chapter again, because my opinion of Bryce completely changed.I love this woman.Despite the fact that we are reading a fantasy, despite the fact that Bryce is half-Fae, she is very human in her actions and emotions.  She makes her mistakes, she suffers through them, she learns, she picks herself back up, puts on a new pair of teal-colored panties, and she keeps going.  She's believable and realistic in who she is, and it's very easy to become connected to her.This is actually true of the rest of the characters.  They don't always connect right away—I was unsure of Hunt at first, of Ruhn, of Jesiba even—but once they do, they stick and you root for these people.  You suffer with them, you are excited alongside them, you want them to kick ass and come out winning on the other side.Hunt—or as I like to think of him in my head, Orion...such a gorgeous name—had one of the best evolutions.  I can see that Maas wanted to make him this dark, introverted being at the beginning, and I saw hints of it, but I couldn't quite see him that way full-force.  I think that's one of the things that made me question him for those first few chapters of his appearance in-story.  I see what you want me to see, because you're telling me what to see, but that's not really who he is, and that's coming out more so than the facade he's portraying.  Athie is a deep, tortured, sweet and loving male who slowly opens up to the reader, and he swept me right off my feet.That's probably why the sudden twist at the end of the novel's third part was such a slap to the face, and the biggest problem that I had with this book.We're navigating a story that's centered around the death of Bryce's best friend, Danika, and her pack of shape-shifting wolves—one of the most heartbreaking moments of the book, by the way, even if the synopsis warns us about it (the writing in this piece, at the start, was wonderfully done and it tore through me).  Eventually, we know that Danika's death, and that of the pack, is surrounded by the use of a drug called synth, which makes people—both human and non—have strength and violence to such a degree that they can tear others apart.  And the culmination of that is that Hunt is involved in this so that he, and those with him, can use this drug to help themselves be freed from those who have enslaved them.It did not fit with his character.Hunt, who strives to keep others safe, who works and does the horrible things that his handler, Micah, tells him to do so that he can keeps streets safe?  Hunt, who deals in killing demons that come through rifts?  Yes, he has been suffering for over two hundred years, and he has been tortured within an inch of his life, and the love of his life was killed in the midst of this.  But to make him be a buyer, when he comes to know the consequences of the usage of synth, did not fit in with who he is.  As the last part of the novel progressed, things were smoothed out a bit and it sort of fit in.  But this nagged at me so much that I was not able to let it go.I did, as a matter of fact, stop reading for the day once I hit this point, and had to force myself to pick up the book again the next day so that I could continue.It doesn't take away from the story, mind you.  I said it once, and I say it again, I love this book.  I felt every single emotion that was in here, and that's one of the best things that I can ever ask for in a story: make me feel.  And you certainly feel.  You feel to the point of tears sometimes.  Lehabah's end did it for me, that little fire sprite was one of the good ones.  Bryce's phone call to Hunt when she's in the middle of taking out demons after the Gates open and knows she might very well die, did it for me again.  Danika and Bryce's reunion after Bryce makes her Drop did it for me a third time.  And then that bittersweet moment, near the end of the book, when Bryce gets just a glimpse of the pack and Connor waves to her, brought tears to my eyes once again.But I still think that there is, and was, so much to explore.  And while we're taken to the brink of those moments that can be darker, like the ones that Hunt described having experienced during his years with Sandriel alongside Pollux, we're not taken there.  It's not that I want to see my beloved characters suffer, it's that sometimes that suffering can have room for that much more growth.  Sometimes when we bypass that, things appear a little too easy.At the end of the day, though, this was stellar.  My worry was for nothing, and I am going to be suffering until the second book is so much as announced.  I'm still not over the losses in this first installment, I still remember the epic scene of Bryce against Micah, of Hunt's plummet over that helicopter, of Lehabah's sacrifice.  I am so curious to see how the obscure Aidas ties in with this story and what more he has to offer, and I can't even imagine how the Asteri will likely play a part in the future of this world.Bring it on, Crescent City.  I'm waiting.

The Teacher,32.4,4.3,"I think we have all heard this same story before. Handsome older teacher charms young impressionable teenage girl. He gets in over his head and aims to protect himself and his career. However, in typical Frieda fashion this story takes many interesting twist on a age old saga. The twist left at the very end was what saved this story in my opinion. Had it not been for that my rating would be lower. Not because this story wasn't well written or a fun read, but because it is one we have heard and been beaten over the head with so many times. But of course Fredia didn't let me down. That being said, it is sad stories like these are common place in a way. Sad that so many young kids are taken advantage of by adults with authority that they should be able to trust. Public schools seem to be worse and worse for this sort of thing amongst other problematic issues. If at all possible it is looking better and better to Homeschool your children. But that being said, I give this book a 6.7/10 stars.

The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles,32.4,4.5,"Warning: Very long review. This book has helped me multiple times. In The Art of War, Sun Tzu coined the famous phrase ‘know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.’In The War of Art, Steven Pressfield launches into a similar discussion. In the first section we will discover our enemy: Resistance. The second section discusses our means for combat: Turning Pro. In the third and final section we will see that the battle is between our Self and our Ego.Resistance – Defining the Enemy. This is the first of 3 sections Pressfield shares with us on what he considers to be the enemy of the creator. Resistance is an internal force, the ‘enemy within.’ Defined as self-sabotage, resistance usually manifests as avoidance, procrastination, or inaction caused by fear which creates paralysis. Resistance, according to Pressfield, is invisible, insidious, implacable, internal, impersonal and universal. He elaborates on each of these adjectives (and more), unafraid to use a clever metaphor or simile to illustrate a point. For example, in the section ‘Resistance is infallible, Pressfield writes:“Like a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North-meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing.”Pressfield goes on to point out Resistance in its many guises: the way peers may be recruited as allies of Resistance when an artist starts to conquer Resistance; the people around her “begin acting strange…they are trying to sabotage her” because they are experiencing Resistance of their own. They may begin to feel guilty for not trying to reach their own potential To make themselves feel better, they pressure her either directly or indirectly to backslide. In my case, I have a couple of people who point out how hard I work, don’t I need to take some me time? That sort of thing….Resistance also encourages the artist’s tendency to quit at 99%, procrastinating work in order to not face completion of their work. Completion opens our work up to our peers for review and examination of others. He states that Resistance has no power of its own, only power it receives from our fear.Any one reading it will be able to identify where Resistance has dug it’s claws in at one time or another with many of his examples and definitions. I want to point out that nowhere in his book does Pressfield address the Resistance we also face via the internet, email, Facebook, etc. In one section he mentions completely missing Watergate because he was too busy writing. Apparently he is able to focus on his work so strongly these things that distract many of us have no appeal to him.The second section covers: Combating Resistance – Turning Pro. According to Pressfield, there’s no mystery about turning pro. You just make the decision and by an act of your will it is so. By turning pro, Pressfield is talking about the ideal of becoming a professional, a mindset. You make a decision to sit down and do your craft, or exercise, or whatever, NO MATTER WHAT. No matter what tries to distract you and stop you, you keep going until the day is done. You are professional in your dedication and behavior. “An amateur plays for fun, a professional for keeps.” The amateur lets a cold or minor distractions stop him. The professional knows he needs to do the work, and then get better. The amateur thinks he can quit anytime it gets tough and go back to something else. The professional doesn’t want to quit every time he hits a problem, he has discipline and determination to steady him.Turning pro means basically to prepare a work discipline and follow it. To paraphrase Pressfield’s definition: A pro shows up every day no matter what, stays on the job all day, and is in it for the long haul. For the pro, the stakes are high. Pros accept payment for their work (even if they don’t always make an income). Pros also master the technique of their work, have a sense of humor about their jobs, and receive real-world praise or blame. He explains the hangovers and colds and other things as excuses we use to deflect ourselves from our purpose and from fulfilling our call. An added benefit, if you really love what you do, you will be like a child who looks up from their activities to be surprised to find that it’s time for supper.Also, Pressfield makes a point that we are not to get our identity from the thing we are trying to create. You are still you. Your work should be work, not you. Aside from your calling, your life’s work, you should have an identity that stands alone. If you only have an identity in whatever you are trying to create, you leave yourself vulnerable to the attacks that will come. You will take it all personally and it should never be that way. Your work is what is being attacked, and you should be able to stand back and defend it objectively. Do not over invest your emotional well being in your success or failure. I think this is a common mistake made.You, Inc. – Pressman also brings up the benefits of making yourself a corporation. Even if you only think of yourself in this way it can reinforce the idea of professionalism in your work because it separates the artist-doing-the-work from the consciousness-running-the-show. I love his idea of having status meetings with himself. In corporate America, we have a status meeting every Monday morning, decide on a plan of action and who will take care of what part of that plan, then divvy out the assignments, type it up and distribute it to the various participants. He has one of those meetings with himself every Monday. He sits down and goes over his assignments, decides when to be responsible for what, and types it up and distributes it to himself. Sometimes as Joe-blow he is too intimidated to go out and pimp himself, but as Joe-blow Inc, he enjoys the pimping. He’s not him anymore. He’s Me, Inc.This third and final section talks about the muses and identifies the cause of Resistance through the Self and the Ego. Muses, angels, demons, geniuses, an input from the collective unconsciousness, all these Pressfield calls our allies, “equal and opposite powers…counterpoised against [Resistance].” These allies join us when we make the shift from being an amateur to a professional.In the second section, he heavily stresses professionalism. He states the most important thing about art is work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.“When we sit down day after day and keep grinding…The muse takes note of our dedication. She approves…we becomes like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come.”Following this simple but powerful truth, Pressfield talks about the day he finished his first book. He finally wrote, The End. He received this sage advice from his friend Paul: “Good for you. Start the next one today.” In my words: don’t stop now, you finally have a work ethic that is producing your art.Now: Ego and Self, and the battle between the two. Resistance has its seat in Ego. The Ego is that part of the psyche that believes in material existence, is concerned with its own preservation and comfort, with stasis and the physical, material world. The Ego likes things the way they are. It likes to be in control.The Self, according to Pressfield, is where we grow from. This is where our dreams and ideas come from. When we meditate or pray, this is the part of ourselves we are seeking. Self is our deepest being.Why does the Ego hate the self? According to Pressfield, its …”…because when we seat our consciousness in the Self, we put the ego out of business.” The Ego hates it when the creator sits down to create, whether it’s a book, a painting or an exercise routine. Ego hates to lose control, and tries to cripple Self. It hates creators because they are pathfinders to the future.Pressfield ends the book with a simple call to action: listen to your Self and take action in order to find out what you were meant to do. Once you figure it out, do it like a professional. If you don’t explore and utilize your gifts, you hurt yourself and everyone around you.  If you do, great; you’re sharing your gifts with the world.Pressfield  uses humor and a confident, competent demeanor in what he shares. He’s been there and done this, and wants to share the rewarding fruit he has to show for it, to encourage us to seek that fruit for ourselves. He wants us to be able to overcome our enemy, Resistance, and flourish with our own muses.We all encounter Resistance in one form or another (fear of failure, fear of success, procrastination, avoidance, distraction, etc.). This book is an extremely easy read, and was very encouraging to me personally. I would highly recommend it for anyone facing any new project in their life. You will be surprised by the things this book reveals to you, and you will also see yourself represented in more than one situation Pressfield shares. Steven Pressfield defines the enemy, offers a strategy for overcoming it and shows us the beautiful fruit we can have as a result of our labor: A completed work, a job well done. Eventually success. It all started for him when he was finally able to write: The End.

Resistance is an internal force, the ‘enemy within.’ Defined as self-sabotage, resistance usually manifests as avoidance, procrastination, or inaction caused by fear which creates paralysis. Resistance, according to Pressfield, is invisible, insidious, implacable, internal, impersonal and universal. He elaborates on each of these adjectives (and more), unafraid to use a clever metaphor or simile to illustrate a point. For example, in the section ‘Resistance is infallible, Pressfield writes:“Like a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North-meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing.”Pressfield goes on to point out Resistance in its many guises: the way peers may be recruited as allies of Resistance when an artist starts to conquer Resistance; the people around her “begin acting strange…they are trying to sabotage her” because they are experiencing Resistance of their own. They may begin to feel guilty for not trying to reach their own potential To make themselves feel better, they pressure her either directly or indirectly to backslide. In my case, I have a couple of people who point out how hard I work, don’t I need to take some me time? That sort of thing….Resistance also encourages the artist’s tendency to quit at 99%, procrastinating work in order to not face completion of their work. Completion opens our work up to our peers for review and examination of others. He states that Resistance has no power of its own, only power it receives from our fear.Any one reading it will be able to identify where Resistance has dug it’s claws in at one time or another with many of his examples and definitions. I want to point out that nowhere in his book does Pressfield address the Resistance we also face via the internet, email, Facebook, etc. In one section he mentions completely missing Watergate because he was too busy writing. Apparently he is able to focus on his work so strongly these things that distract many of us have no appeal to him.The second section covers: Combating Resistance – Turning Pro. According to Pressfield, there’s no mystery about turning pro. You just make the decision and by an act of your will it is so. By turning pro, Pressfield is talking about the ideal of becoming a professional, a mindset. You make a decision to sit down and do your craft, or exercise, or whatever, NO MATTER WHAT. No matter what tries to distract you and stop you, you keep going until the day is done. You are professional in your dedication and behavior. “An amateur plays for fun, a professional for keeps.” The amateur lets a cold or minor distractions stop him. The professional knows he needs to do the work, and then get better. The amateur thinks he can quit anytime it gets tough and go back to something else. The professional doesn’t want to quit every time he hits a problem, he has discipline and determination to steady him.Turning pro means basically to prepare a work discipline and follow it. To paraphrase Pressfield’s definition: A pro shows up every day no matter what, stays on the job all day, and is in it for the long haul. For the pro, the stakes are high. Pros accept payment for their work (even if they don’t always make an income). Pros also master the technique of their work, have a sense of humor about their jobs, and receive real-world praise or blame. He explains the hangovers and colds and other things as excuses we use to deflect ourselves from our purpose and from fulfilling our call. An added benefit, if you really love what you do, you will be like a child who looks up from their activities to be surprised to find that it’s time for supper.Also, Pressfield makes a point that we are not to get our identity from the thing we are trying to create. You are still you. Your work should be work, not you. Aside from your calling, your life’s work, you should have an identity that stands alone. If you only have an identity in whatever you are trying to create, you leave yourself vulnerable to the attacks that will come. You will take it all personally and it should never be that way. Your work is what is being attacked, and you should be able to stand back and defend it objectively. Do not over invest your emotional well being in your success or failure. I think this is a common mistake made.You, Inc. – Pressman also brings up the benefits of making yourself a corporation. Even if you only think of yourself in this way it can reinforce the idea of professionalism in your work because it separates the artist-doing-the-work from the consciousness-running-the-show. I love his idea of having status meetings with himself. In corporate America, we have a status meeting every Monday morning, decide on a plan of action and who will take care of what part of that plan, then divvy out the assignments, type it up and distribute it to the various participants. He has one of those meetings with himself every Monday. He sits down and goes over his assignments, decides when to be responsible for what, and types it up and distributes it to himself. Sometimes as Joe-blow he is too intimidated to go out and pimp himself, but as Joe-blow Inc, he enjoys the pimping. He’s not him anymore. He’s Me, Inc.This third and final section talks about the muses and identifies the cause of Resistance through the Self and the Ego. Muses, angels, demons, geniuses, an input from the collective unconsciousness, all these Pressfield calls our allies, “equal and opposite powers…counterpoised against [Resistance].” These allies join us when we make the shift from being an amateur to a professional.In the second section, he heavily stresses professionalism. He states the most important thing about art is work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.“When we sit down day after day and keep grinding…The muse takes note of our dedication. She approves…we becomes like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come.”Following this simple but powerful truth, Pressfield talks about the day he finished his first book. He finally wrote, The End. He received this sage advice from his friend Paul: “Good for you. Start the next one today.” In my words: don’t stop now, you finally have a work ethic that is producing your art.Now: Ego and Self, and the battle between the two. Resistance has its seat in Ego. The Ego is that part of the psyche that believes in material existence, is concerned with its own preservation and comfort, with stasis and the physical, material world. The Ego likes things the way they are. It likes to be in control.The Self, according to Pressfield, is where we grow from. This is where our dreams and ideas come from. When we meditate or pray, this is the part of ourselves we are seeking. Self is our deepest being.Why does the Ego hate the self? According to Pressfield, its …”…because when we seat our consciousness in the Self, we put the ego out of business.” The Ego hates it when the creator sits down to create, whether it’s a book, a painting or an exercise routine. Ego hates to lose control, and tries to cripple Self. It hates creators because they are pathfinders to the future.Pressfield ends the book with a simple call to action: listen to your Self and take action in order to find out what you were meant to do. Once you figure it out, do it like a professional. If you don’t explore and utilize your gifts, you hurt yourself and everyone around you.  If you do, great; you’re sharing your gifts with the world.Pressfield  uses humor and a confident, competent demeanor in what he shares. He’s been there and done this, and wants to share the rewarding fruit he has to show for it, to encourage us to seek that fruit for ourselves. He wants us to be able to overcome our enemy, Resistance, and flourish with our own muses.We all encounter Resistance in one form or another (fear of failure, fear of success, procrastination, avoidance, distraction, etc.). This book is an extremely easy read, and was very encouraging to me personally. I would highly recommend it for anyone facing any new project in their life. You will be surprised by the things this book reveals to you, and you will also see yourself represented in more than one situation Pressfield shares. Steven Pressfield defines the enemy, offers a strategy for overcoming it and shows us the beautiful fruit we can have as a result of our labor: A completed work, a job well done. Eventually success. It all started for him when he was finally able to write: The End.

Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear,32.4,4.5,"“Are you considering being a creative person? Too late, you already are one,” Gilbert asserts. In Big Magic, living a creative life means living a life driven by curiosity over fear and this life is accessible to all who seek it. She breaks down creativity into five essential ingredients: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. Whether readers believe in a magical world or not, her description of ideas, why they choose us, and when and why they leave is inspiring to no end and her roadmap through the twists, turns, and potential pitfalls of creativity are applicable to all who dare to venture on their own creative journey.Gilbert tackles our biggest creative fears and inner demons head-on with delicious humor, wit, and grace. She allows fear a spacious spot in the car on our creative road trip, but never allows it to give us directions and certainly not take the driver’s seat. Time and again, she effectively and effortlessly silences our inner critic on such universal experiences as: worrying about what others think of us and our creations, bowing to perfectionism instead of completion, evaluating our art as low or high, as brilliant or a disaster, the struggle to declare ourselves worthy of living a creative life, the desire to be fearless or passionate when all we need is courage and curiosity, and much more. She also explores various paradoxes of creativity: the desire for permission and the fact that we never needed it to begin with, that creativity takes persistent hard work on our part and also moments of divine inspiration that come from something else entirely, that no creation is entirely original and yet authentic expressions are always original, and the ultimate paradox: that our creative expression must be the most important thing in the world and it also must not matter at all.Written in easy to digest, bite-size chapters, readers will feel as if they’re chatting over a glass of wine with their amusing and insightful bestie, Liz, as she masterfully weaves together numerous stories from her personal and professional life with hard-earned creative wisdom, always with an endearing self-awareness that at times borders on self-deprecation, and with a charm that is nearly flirtatious. The lessons are so powerful and relatable that if one were to learn this much about their creative life in a year of therapy, they could consider it a great investment. Big Magic ultimately provides readers with the necessary courage and inspiration to live bigger, happier, and more interesting lives, coaxing out of us our own unique hidden treasures.-- Lisa Blair, MA

A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 2),32.4,4.8,"I seriously don't even know where to begin with this review because all I want to do is fangirl so hard over how much I ADORED this book! Seriously people...every single word, every single scene is so gorgeously written and breathtaking that I had to stop multiple times while I was reading just to admire and appreciate what I just read. This book was absolutely excellent on so many levels that no words can do it justice (but I'm going to try because this is a review after all haha). I don't think it's any secret that Sarah J. Maas is an amazeballs author, but in case you need a reminder, just read this book and you will see the supreme talent this woman has. She could write a phone book and I would read it because somehow even that would be an amazing read. I've only said this about 1 or 2 other authors, but it's completely true.“There are different kinds of darkness,” Rhys said. I kept my eyes shut. “There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”This book made me feel so many different things at once, and literally it has it ALL! There are amazing twists, snarky banter, beautiful writing, and just plain badass, awesome characters that you want to be best friends with. After finishing this book all I want to do is be in the Night Court and be apart of Rhysand's inner circle. It's probably unhealthy how badly I want this to happen right now. But even more, SJM wrote scenes bursting with heart-pounding action, swoonworthy romance (which be warned, will leaving you squeeing), and female empowerment...GAH! I NEVER wanted to stop reading. But you know what I loved the most? Even though this story is a romance, it is also a story of self-discovery.“I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless againI would not, could not be broken.”Feyre goes through so much and is incredibly strong. She is extremely relatable because even though she loses herself for a bit, she finds that inner fire that she once had and it causes a spark to ignite within her. She becomes even more amazing than her character was previously, and finds herself on her own. Feyre is such an admirable and relatable character. I mean who among us hasn't felt lost at one point or the other in their life?? Feyre shows everyone that you have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength to rise above and accept the past, and never let that thing that caused you to be lost define you. We need to embrace the pain and the anguish that came with the hand life has dealt, and choose to move forward in life...or we will remain lost. The character development for Feyre was seriously one of the best character development's I have ever read, and I think SJM deserves a HUGE round of applause for giving all readers this character. She becomes stronger and more determined than ever to accomplish what she has set out to do. All the while she remains the stubborn and sassy character we love.“I was not prey any longer, I decided as I eased up to that door.And I was not a mouse.I was a wolf.”Rhysand...literally I have no words for my love. My heart (and ovaries) were literally bursting with every word he said. He broke my heart multiple times, and there was one scene in particular where I was gross sobbing when he was revealing things to Feyre. He still remains that mysterious Dark Lord, but we are able to understand and see so much more of him than ever before. Like Feyre, Rhys grew so much in this novel, and I loved watching how he became a little less broken due to Feyre's presence in his life. Feyre provides a nice balance to Rhys, and they're banter is like no other. We all know how shameless a flirt Rhys is, but boy does he step it up in this book...and I loved every single second of it. He had me laughing so hard countless times, and I can't even tell you how much I love him.The world that SJM has created is simply phenomenal, and I seriously don't know how she came up with her ideas, but let's just thank whoever that she did. There is so much to this world that we didn't know, and I loved learning so many new things over the course of the book. We visit more courts and see different races. We see the political uneasiness that ultimately exists in this world, and how alliances can change at the drop of a hat. And then comes the ending...it is brutal and ripped my heart out, but it left me begging for more! For the entire conclusion I basically had my jaw permanently dropped and then my heart torn out because of the events that SJM wrote. But all I know is that I can't wait to see where she takes this series in the next book because there are truly endless possibilities!“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”If you couldn't tell already, you need to read this book as soon as possible because this is the best book of 2016 so far!Happy reading :)

A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 3),32.4,4.8,"“When you erupt, girl, make sure it is felt across worlds.”I seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review. I'm going to try not to include any spoilers, but if there are any, I'll give you fair warning before reading further. Honestly, I am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book. I honestly don't know how SJM can top this book, but let's get real here...she will because she's just that amazing. I read this in one sitting overnight because I simply couldn't put it down. It's true, this book is a Court of Pain and Feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and I felt incomplete after finishing. SJM seriously took her writing to new heights, and I can't even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journey.“The great joy and honour of my life has been to know you. To call you my family. And I am grateful - more than I can possibly say - that I was given this time with you all.”I have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because I always felt that it showed Sarah J. Maas' extreme writing talent. It's so different from the Throne of Glass series, and I loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story. You can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her, and every scene is richly described. Her writing truly sweeps you away and it's something that you easily lose yourself in. I know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into Feyre's world, I would not even hesitate. This story is complex and I never expected for SJM to build on the world so much more than previously, but she does, and it's excellent. There is a great progression to the story, and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characters.“What we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength.”The book starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While some people might have found this part slow, I think it showcased just how far Feyre has come as a character. The strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her (and Rhysand's) plot was utterly fantastic! I think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us Feyre's mindset at the time. I definitely got some Aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass Feyre was, which just added to my love for her character. But the best thing: Feyre's characterization. I thought she was well-developed already, but SJM added yet another layer to her character. Feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book. Looking back, I can't even believe that this is the same person...and that is an excellent thing. It shows how much Rhys and the Night Court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately become.“I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.”Rhys is as perfect as ever. I mean come on...who doesn't love him?! The way he treats Feyre made me swoon every darn time, and she is his High Lady in every single way. He gives her something that Tamlin never did...respect. He believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing. He allows her to spread her wings (<-- this is an excellent pun btw...I know I'm really not as funny as I think) and embrace her magic. The constant support and love Rhys shows her is something every girl should have. Plus, he's freaking hilarious...you can't get a better man! I honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top 5 book boyfriends. Obviously the chemistry between Feyre and Rhys is off the charts, and all the sex scenes are perfectly written. I love them together so much, it just makes my heart happy.“It's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.”Cassian and Nesta are brilliant and I firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books. I need them together, and I need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story! They have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book. We learn more about Mor, and my heart broke for her multiple times. I just wanted to give her a giant hug, but I loved delving deeper into her character. Azriel is brooding as ever, but I love him. There is definitely something up with him and Elain, and I need to know what that something is. Amren's sass is pure gold and I love her so much. There are definitely some surprises with her character that left me (along with the characters) shocked. We also meet a new High Lord, Helion and god do I love him! He has to be in these next 3 books because he's awesome. We also see the return of the Bone Carver and the Suriel. And seriously...they play epic roles in the story. And Tamlin...I have to mention this guy. I actually liked how SJM handled him in this book (especially at the end). It was realistic and believable. And (Lord help me), I didn't hate him anymore.“My rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.”My favorite part about this book though (besides all the other stuff) is its unpredictability. Seriously, SJM gave me a heart attack multiple times. Just when I thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story. And there was not 1, not 2, but 3 major things at the end in which I was freaking out and making very weird noises that I'm sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate. The one MAJOR (and I mean MAJOR) thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock. I seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life, and I was praying so hard that SJM didn't do what she did. I think I stopped breathing at one point, so HOW DARE YOU SARAH J MAAS!! HOW DARE YOU SCARE ME LIKE THAT!“It is a new world, and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anew.”If you couldn't tell, I LOVED this book! I still am not okay after reading the entire battle since SJM made me lose my mind, but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything I could want. Most of the main questions were answered, but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing. I think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters' perspectives, but I'm never going to mind more Feyre and Rhys. This is by far the best read of 2017, and you need to read it as soon as humanly possible!Happy reading :)

Circe,32.4,4.6,"This was a very intense story. It read similar to the Illiad or Odyssey but not in verse. I loved this because the author did a wonderful job showing how women were nothing but another commodity for men to use for their pleasure. Gods and men. It felt realistic. The struggle to keep her son safe pulled at my heartstrings since I'm a mother to a very adventurous boy as well. Great story but very slow.

"House of Earth and Blood: Crescent City, Book 1",32.4,4.7,"Being the fan of an author's work is both a blessing and a curse.  You count down the days until their next—usually hyped up—release is to be published.  You talk about it more and more the closer that said release day approaches.  You try to enter any possible pre-order special is available, in the hope of getting a lovely exclusive pin, or a poster, or a print.And then the book releases...I don't know about you, but once that book hits shelves, I am violently torn between a crazed eagerness to read it, and a nearly crippling fear that I am going to hate the book no matter how much I have loved this author's stories in the past.  Which, let's face it, is one of the worst things to happen in a reader's life.Thank you, Maas, for delivering the goods once again.House of Earth and Blood is not a perfect novel.  I'm not even sure that such a thing is possible, to be frank, because our love of books is a very personal thing.  But, this novel is a punch to the heart, in the best possible way.  I absolutely fell in love with the story, with the characters, with the world that was created.  And it is definitely a complex and intricate world of which we get a glimpse, but that is sure to open up to us even more, and I cannot wait to continue exploring it as the series progresses.I'm a huge fan of badass female leads in novels.  What can I say, I live vicariously through them.  Ironically, I usually don't like so-called “badass” female leads in novels, because most of the time what we're given are annoying females that try too hard.  I initially read the sample for HoEaB that NetGalley provided, and I was a bit unsure about Bryce.  She came off a tad strong for me, and I was instantly worried that this meant negativity throughout the rest of the novel.  Maybe my mindset was not in its proper place then, but I am so glad that I decided to read the full novel from the first chapter again, because my opinion of Bryce completely changed.I love this woman.Despite the fact that we are reading a fantasy, despite the fact that Bryce is half-Fae, she is very human in her actions and emotions.  She makes her mistakes, she suffers through them, she learns, she picks herself back up, puts on a new pair of teal-colored panties, and she keeps going.  She's believable and realistic in who she is, and it's very easy to become connected to her.This is actually true of the rest of the characters.  They don't always connect right away—I was unsure of Hunt at first, of Ruhn, of Jesiba even—but once they do, they stick and you root for these people.  You suffer with them, you are excited alongside them, you want them to kick ass and come out winning on the other side.Hunt—or as I like to think of him in my head, Orion...such a gorgeous name—had one of the best evolutions.  I can see that Maas wanted to make him this dark, introverted being at the beginning, and I saw hints of it, but I couldn't quite see him that way full-force.  I think that's one of the things that made me question him for those first few chapters of his appearance in-story.  I see what you want me to see, because you're telling me what to see, but that's not really who he is, and that's coming out more so than the facade he's portraying.  Athie is a deep, tortured, sweet and loving male who slowly opens up to the reader, and he swept me right off my feet.That's probably why the sudden twist at the end of the novel's third part was such a slap to the face, and the biggest problem that I had with this book.We're navigating a story that's centered around the death of Bryce's best friend, Danika, and her pack of shape-shifting wolves—one of the most heartbreaking moments of the book, by the way, even if the synopsis warns us about it (the writing in this piece, at the start, was wonderfully done and it tore through me).  Eventually, we know that Danika's death, and that of the pack, is surrounded by the use of a drug called synth, which makes people—both human and non—have strength and violence to such a degree that they can tear others apart.  And the culmination of that is that Hunt is involved in this so that he, and those with him, can use this drug to help themselves be freed from those who have enslaved them.It did not fit with his character.Hunt, who strives to keep others safe, who works and does the horrible things that his handler, Micah, tells him to do so that he can keeps streets safe?  Hunt, who deals in killing demons that come through rifts?  Yes, he has been suffering for over two hundred years, and he has been tortured within an inch of his life, and the love of his life was killed in the midst of this.  But to make him be a buyer, when he comes to know the consequences of the usage of synth, did not fit in with who he is.  As the last part of the novel progressed, things were smoothed out a bit and it sort of fit in.  But this nagged at me so much that I was not able to let it go.I did, as a matter of fact, stop reading for the day once I hit this point, and had to force myself to pick up the book again the next day so that I could continue.It doesn't take away from the story, mind you.  I said it once, and I say it again, I love this book.  I felt every single emotion that was in here, and that's one of the best things that I can ever ask for in a story: make me feel.  And you certainly feel.  You feel to the point of tears sometimes.  Lehabah's end did it for me, that little fire sprite was one of the good ones.  Bryce's phone call to Hunt when she's in the middle of taking out demons after the Gates open and knows she might very well die, did it for me again.  Danika and Bryce's reunion after Bryce makes her Drop did it for me a third time.  And then that bittersweet moment, near the end of the book, when Bryce gets just a glimpse of the pack and Connor waves to her, brought tears to my eyes once again.But I still think that there is, and was, so much to explore.  And while we're taken to the brink of those moments that can be darker, like the ones that Hunt described having experienced during his years with Sandriel alongside Pollux, we're not taken there.  It's not that I want to see my beloved characters suffer, it's that sometimes that suffering can have room for that much more growth.  Sometimes when we bypass that, things appear a little too easy.At the end of the day, though, this was stellar.  My worry was for nothing, and I am going to be suffering until the second book is so much as announced.  I'm still not over the losses in this first installment, I still remember the epic scene of Bryce against Micah, of Hunt's plummet over that helicopter, of Lehabah's sacrifice.  I am so curious to see how the obscure Aidas ties in with this story and what more he has to offer, and I can't even imagine how the Asteri will likely play a part in the future of this world.Bring it on, Crescent City.  I'm waiting.

A Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 5),32.4,4.8,"Oh, Sarah J. Maas, you've done it again with ""A Court of Silver Flames""! I loved it so many great moments and the ending had my eyes watering. Did someone cut an onion up in here? 😜 I have so many spiraling theories of what is to come especially if you have read any other books by her 👀 Who else is spiraling here?This book is a mesmerizing dance between characters, emotions, and the haunting echoes of a war-torn world. Nesta Archeron, the fiery and complex heroine, takes center stage, and it's a performance that leaves you wanting more. I will admit her character development has finally grown on me. Hoping that we see another side to her and Cassian as the series continues. Cannot wait for Elain's book!Nesta's journey from a prickly High Fae struggling to find her place to a character wrestling with her demons is a rollercoaster of emotions. And the chemistry between Nesta and Cassian? The sparks, the tension, it's like a burning flame you can't look away from. Here for it!Maas continues to weave a world where darkness and desire collide, and ""A Court of Silver Flames"" is no exception.

Those three concepts are CODE, PARA, and Highlighting 2.0 (or Progressive Summarization).CODE: Capture, Organize, Distill, Express is a nice easy to remember acronym for the ""second brain"" and how we are to think of it.PARA: (Projects, Areas, Resource, Archive) is a subset of Organize and is how the ""brain"" is structured. Which changes the ""normal"" way we think of folder hierarchy in a very powerful way. Most of the things we do in our daily lives are Projects, but we save the data for a project in different ""areas"" and ""resources"" (i.e. unrelated folders) and aren't easy to find using browsing and thus create bloat that is never used and continues to grow, PARA is here to solve that.Lastly, Highlighting 2.0: is a powerful way to capture and distill the just of something you've read or written.  So, that when you come back to it in 20 years you don't need to read it all over to understand why it was important in the first place (in less of course you wish to do so).The bad:About 50% of this book, probably more (particularly the first 100 pages or so), are portrayal, fluff, salesmanship, cheer-leading, and war stories mean to inspire the reader.  Not only is this a huge waste of everyone's time, the author's system should inspire based upon it's own merits and because there was so much ""extra"", the book wasn't as practical and/or applicable as it could/should have been.This lack of applicability is evident in the fact that they author had to write a second book titled PARA to clarify and expound on the matter when he should have done so in this current book; and unfortunately, based upon what the author has said in this book, I doubt that his second book will truly clarify the matter.  In fact, a review of ""The PARA Method"" by Dennis M says essentially that, ""While it does expand on the method, you should be able to get everything you need from BASB"".Additionally, Forte lays out a system that is more expansive than the scope of this book alone, leaving the reader to fend for themselves.Epilogue:This is a book that probably should have 5-stars, but tittered dangerously close to being 3-stars.  The author has some good insights, he just doesn't execute the transfer of knowledge well in this book and thus the reader must fend for themselves to really implement what the author is trying to convey and will most likely take many reads/look-backs to fully grasp the fully utility of the message. My biggest gripe with this book, is that there's so much extra fluff and trying to sell you on the method and not enough instruction and application. Forte outlines the four methods to find data in his system, the first two being searching (which is easy enough), browsing (which Forte himself cite a study showing this is the preferred method by humans to sieve data) however due to the simplicity and flatness of his PARA system (as is) true browsing is seemingly impossible and it's not clear as how one should rectify this.  Forte seems to suggest that we shouldn't worry about it, because not everything is going to be useful, but then why bother organizing at all if you can't find an item you need.

Fourth Wing (The Empyrean Book 1),32.4,4.8,"10/5 starsThe world building, pace of the story, and characters were all amazing. Moments of hilarity in between moments of plot. I loved the characters and how they developed. I wanted to root for Dain and hope I was wrong, but he just pissed me off as the book carried on. I had serious rage levels every time he would try to step in to protect Violet or opened his mouth.I have been so invested in a story in such a long time, but this book gripped me by the shoulders and yanked me inside. Violet and Xaden‘s story developed in a way that I could see happening, but not anticipate how it would go. Finish the story in a day and a half, because I couldn’t put it down!If you’d like to read a story that has amazing world building, dragons, magic, a heroine who stands up for herself, and an amazing plot  - READ THIS BOOK.And the end! I am relieved that “Iron Flame” is out and I don’t have to wait for it. I will definitely be reading that next!

NEO CHAIR Ergonomic Office Chair PU Leather Executive Chair Padded Flip Up Armrest Computer Chair Adjustable Height High Back Lumbar Support Wheels Swivel for Gaming Desk Chair (White),32.4,4.3,"This is an exceptional price for this quality chair. It only took 30 minutes to put together. The directions are very explicit and easy to follow. There is only one tool needed to put the chair together, and they even supply it along with the bolts needed. I'm a woman in my sixties and I found it very easy to put together by myself. It looks beautiful and luxurious. I love that the seat raises to a full 23 inches. My last chair only went up 20 inches and it was not high enough for my desk. This is perfect!  Of course, the chair can rock back and forth as well. Another great feature is that when you are done working you can raise the armrests so that the chair can slide all the way into the desk saving lots of room. My other chair was giving me lower back pain. No pain at all in this chair. Well worth the investment. The only issue I had was that the right armrest had black scratches and staining on the silver structure area. The rest of the chair was perfect. So I emailed the company at their customer service email address. They responded very quickly and within just a few days sent me a brand new right arm piece unit at no charge that was in perfect condition. Excellent customer service. Very pleased. 5 stars.

I've heard some dislike for this book and expression of not understanding why this book was needed. For me, it was the perfect story to have before the craziness of the final book.

A place to show where Tamlin truly is and to see how happy Amren is. This was a much needed story, and I'm thankful for it. Onto the next!

"House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, 1)",32.4,4.7,"Spoiler Free Part:I'm going to start off by saying that I am a moderate SJM fan. I tried but failed to ever get into her Throne of Glass series (particularly thrown off by the multiple love interest changes) and really only got truly into ACoTR series towards the end of the first book. While I liked her writing style, I just couldn't connect with the characters. The last third of ACoTR was the first time I felt like the characters were interesting and the plot became engaging. So, I say this without rose colored glasses- I liked House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City Book 1). I thought it was well written, interesting and I connected with the characters. My biggest love of the book was the deep and real feeling of unquestioning love between the two best friends, Bryce and Danika. It's not a spoiler to say that Danika is murdered, as its in the book blurb, but I had totally forgotten and was absolutely gutted when it happened. Bryce's grief for her friend felt so real throughout the books. I think that was what made me empathize with and like her beyond her sassiness. Also, I for one didnt mind the partying and drug use specifically because its depicted that she realized she was basically wasted her life chasing stupid pleasures and not doing anything meaningful. However, this book has a TON of info dump and exposition. I'll go into it more below in the spoiler section, but there is a LOT of information for the reader to process constantly, and new characters are introduced constantly as well making it feel like there are just too many cast to keep track of. The relationship between Hunt & Bryce feels organic to me and I didn't feel that it was ""insta-love"" as some others have complained. It made sense to me that they were the only two people who saw each other as they really were. My biggest gripe is that the very last bit of the book feels like it was supposed to be part of one of her other series compared to the rest of the story.Overall I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars, it was far from perfect but it was highly enjoyable and I'm anticipating the next book in the series.********SPOILERS**********DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!I really loved the relationship between Bryce and her friends throughout the book. They felt very real and genuine. Even the relationship with Rhun felt nicely done. The friend characters were well fleshed out and didnt feel too two dimensional.I really like the world building. I think the caste system and the way the Vanir reign is well explained and makes sense. I thought the concept of ""The Drop"" was unique and interesting.And of course, I loved Danika. Oh boy did I love Danika, and I was heartbroken when she died, because I had forgotten it was coming. When Lele died, I was also genuinely saddened. I felt like the emotions in the book were really well done. Although some people complained about the multiple dead-end leads, I enjoyed them (at one point I was certain Sabine was the killer) because it would have been really boring if they just easily figured it out right away. The Kristillos demon was kind of a disappointment. I mean, it took down Micah but really didn't seem that dangerous overall.I liked Aidas and am intrigued to see him return in future books.I also liked the war between Humans & Vanir. That was something that ACoTR hinted at being a possibility but I think the concept of rebelling against their masters and finding a way to fight back was a good plotline; however I also think Bryce doesn't seem to care too much about their cause. She is always befriending and trying to free slaves, her parents are humans, but she doesn't seem to care all that much about the overall subjugation of multiple species. It kind of gets treated like ""thats the way it is"" without any sense of outrage or hatred about it.Alright now for some gripes:Fury is just a carbon copy of Amren. What is the point of her whole character? Bryce could have been partying with June that night; Rhun could have put a gun to Hunts head and rode Bryce off on the wave runner; Rhun also could have been the one with a helicopter stashed off site. What did Fury actually do for the plot?Everyone is soooooooooooo super crazy off the charts perfectly hot, and also, everyone is insanely deadly. Now I get it, they are Vanir and Angels, but come on. Is there no such thing as an ugly werewolf or an unattractive mermaid? And everyone is a super honed amazing assassin. Fury, Bryce's adopted dad, Rhun and his friends, Hunt, every werewolf, etc. Everyone is stunningly hot and dangerous. To us, they might be, but if that was your entire world your entire life wouldnt it seem a little trite? If everyone is hot, does it mean anything anymore?Also like others have said, jesus with the overkill about Bryce being scorch-the-earth-hot. I get it if Conner & Hunt are super attracted to her, and if she gets hit on occasionally. But it is literally like every male she meets throughout the book can't bear to keep their hands off her. Every time she walks down the street every male is just falling all over themselves to look at her. It definitely feels slathered on a little thick.One of the biggest things that bugs me though is this: The last third of the book. Oh my god. Everything happening on screen, Micah going all Bond Villain and giving a long monologue explaining everything he did and why and just happened to be on camera for everyone important to see. Eye roll. We weren't even with Bryce during most of the action but rather watching it alongside the other secondary characters. The whole scene with the Nok was absolutely unnecessary and just felt like it was dragging out the ending of the book. Micah could have slammed Bryce into the tank, resulting in it cracking and her being severely injured, and Lele still could have broken the glass without the whole Syrinx-Rescue/Nok-Fight even needing to happen. In fact, it would have felt more believable that the Nok fought Micah and occupied him long enough for Bryce to escape than for Micah, the Archangel, the immensely powerful Governor, to have been....conveniently locked in a magically warded bathroom while a whole other scene got played out. It just felt totally unnecessary.Okay- now- last major gripe:THE LAST 50 PAGES OF THE BOOK. What the hell? Did we suddenly get transported into A Court of Thorn and Roses? Portals to Hel opening up all over the city, the lead character running around fighting in hand-to hand combat to protect helpless citizens, the magical companions fighting demons with her.......it felt like I was suddenly watching Feyre, not Bryce. On top of that, while I appreciate the symbolism of Bryce using Danika's sword, it felt totally unrealistic to see a woman who spent the last five years of her life first partying and being a college student then an antiquities desk clerk suddenly is an amazing sword wielding killer. The gun thing is believable due to her Stepfather and the scene at the gun range. But we never once see Bryce mention ever knowing how to use a sword or pick one up, but suddenly she's single handedly taking on an army of demons with flawless sword fighting? I really enjoyed the ending bit with her making the Drop and Danika being there (so touching) but other than that the very last part of the book suddenly felt like it was just a rehashing of the battle scene from A Court of Mist & Fury.The ending of the book wrapped everything up pretty well, but it also leaves a lot unanswered. Bryce admits that the entire city saw her use her Starborn powers and that she is now more powerful than any other mixed-species has ever been before. She even says the Fae & Angels can't let it stand that she showed their caste system was invalid. And yet, the highest Angels told her just to lay low and they would leave them alone. Obviously, we know that they probably don't, but I feel like a cliffhanger as to what would happen now in the fate of humans Vs Vanir/Angels and what that revelation was going to mean for Bryce would have worked better than just wrapping it up in a neat but not really logical bow.I still liked the books, I still like the characters and I am excited for the next one, but hopefully some of these issues will be corrected going forwards.Anyway that concludes my long as heck summary, thanks for reading!!!

The last chapter bring all of the twists and turns into a solid focus (and it will keep twisting and turning until that chapter, which I LOVE)  However, she throws a MASSIVE MASSIVE BLINDSIDING CURVEBALL at you that you will never see coming too lol (Do yourself a favor and DONT read ahead just because you saw this review, Dont ruin it for yourself!

I've read similar ideas from other authors, with different backgrounds, all with their own spins, and I find this one very refreshing. It might seem at times that it's only focused on the creative ""arts"", but this applies to everything.I bought both the Kindle book and the audio since Iike alternating between them. However, the fact that it is narrated by Elizabeth herself made the whole thing much, much better!If anything, this books is a great reminder to not take things so seriously. Enjoy what you do. Stay active. Don't stop making things. Don't let inertia rob you of the precious time we have in this Earth. If you decide to read it, do so with an open mind, and use it to analyze yourself.

Circe,32.4,4.6,"My experience with Greek mythology was first instilled by the movies of Ray Harryhausen. I loved Jason and the Argonauts as a kid and still do to this day. I may have read some condensed little bits of Greek myth while in middle school. It was not until I attended college that I was exposed to Ovid's Metamorphosis. And although I found Homer interesting, overall I thought The Odyssey was pretty dry. Maybe it was just the translation I read.Madeline Miller's new novel, Circe is in no way dry or boring. It takes the old myths that we are familiar with and weaves them together into a narrative that is captivating, engaging, and fresh. Reading Circe is akin to sitting is a great hall after a meal while a poet recites tales of love, passion, loss and magic. The lights are dim and a crackling fire is burning on the hearth.Circe is the daughter of Helios, Titan god of the sun. A seemingly black sheep of the family she is exiled after showing kindness to Prometheus who was punished by Zeus for bringing fire to mortals. It is here that Circe's story begins to take off. She is exiled to the island of Aiaia. On this island she hones her craft of herbcraft, referred to as pharmaka. To the gods it is considered witchcraft.But even in exile she receives visitors. The first is Hermes, the messenger of the gods. He doesn't care about her exile status and finds her fascinating. He brings her news of the outside world, of the wars of man and the petty squabbles between the gods.We later get glimpses of Circe's family. Her sister is Pasiphaë, wife if King Minos of Crete, and mother of the Minotaur. Her brother is Aeëtes, King of Colchis and keeper of the Golden Fleece. Through her eyes we get a unique perspective on the old myths that so many of us grew up on.Circe is probably best remembered as the witch that Odysseus encounters and basically shacks up with for a year while returning from the Trojan Wars. And true to the spirit of the this narrative, Miller presents presents a different perspective on the familiar tale as told by Homer.Madeline Miller has managed to take the old and present it as something that is fresh, and told in a style that is engaging and hard to put down. The language flows smoothly and is almost conversational in ton. It's perfect for the first person perspective that it is written in. Of special note, the audiobook, as narrated by Perdita Weeks, is exceptionally performed with nuanced storyteller like performance. It is Perdita Weeks' first book narration and I hope to here more of her performances.One of the underlying themes of the novel is the perception of women in the world of the Greek myths. Miller explores that not only with Circe, but with Medea and Penelope as well who had been given short shift in most other interpretations. Jason and Odysseus are not the heroes that they have often been portrayed as and the reason why Circe changes any men that come to her island to pigs is understandable and as far as I'm concerned better than some deserved.What Miller has done is something special and hopefully can be taught alongside Homer and Ovid in Classics courses in the future. Despite it being a retelling of stories thousands of years  old, its style is modern, and relevant. Highly Recommended.

I tried but failed to ever get into her Throne of Glass series (particularly thrown off by the multiple love interest changes) and really only got truly into ACoTR series towards the end of the first book. While I liked her writing style, I just couldn't connect with the characters. The last third of ACoTR was the first time I felt like the characters were interesting and the plot became engaging. So, I say this without rose colored glasses- I liked House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City Book 1). I thought it was well written, interesting and I connected with the characters. My biggest love of the book was the deep and real feeling of unquestioning love between the two best friends, Bryce and Danika. It's not a spoiler to say that Danika is murdered, as its in the book blurb, but I had totally forgotten and was absolutely gutted when it happened. Bryce's grief for her friend felt so real throughout the books. I think that was what made me empathize with and like her beyond her sassiness. Also, I for one didnt mind the partying and drug use specifically because its depicted that she realized she was basically wasted her life chasing stupid pleasures and not doing anything meaningful. However, this book has a TON of info dump and exposition. I'll go into it more below in the spoiler section, but there is a LOT of information for the reader to process constantly, and new characters are introduced constantly as well making it feel like there are just too many cast to keep track of. The relationship between Hunt & Bryce feels organic to me and I didn't feel that it was ""insta-love"" as some others have complained. It made sense to me that they were the only two people who saw each other as they really were. My biggest gripe is that the very last bit of the book feels like it was supposed to be part of one of her other series compared to the rest of the story.Overall I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars, it was far from perfect but it was highly enjoyable and I'm anticipating the next book in the series.********SPOILERS**********DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!I really loved the relationship between Bryce and her friends throughout the book. They felt very real and genuine. Even the relationship with Rhun felt nicely done. The friend characters were well fleshed out and didnt feel too two dimensional.I really like the world building. I think the caste system and the way the Vanir reign is well explained and makes sense. I thought the concept of ""The Drop"" was unique and interesting.And of course, I loved Danika. Oh boy did I love Danika, and I was heartbroken when she died, because I had forgotten it was coming. When Lele died, I was also genuinely saddened. I felt like the emotions in the book were really well done. Although some people complained about the multiple dead-end leads, I enjoyed them (at one point I was certain Sabine was the killer) because it would have been really boring if they just easily figured it out right away. The Kristillos demon was kind of a disappointment. I mean, it took down Micah but really didn't seem that dangerous overall.I liked Aidas and am intrigued to see him return in future books.I also liked the war between Humans & Vanir. That was something that ACoTR hinted at being a possibility but I think the concept of rebelling against their masters and finding a way to fight back was a good plotline; however I also think Bryce doesn't seem to care too much about their cause. She is always befriending and trying to free slaves, her parents are humans, but she doesn't seem to care all that much about the overall subjugation of multiple species. It kind of gets treated like ""thats the way it is"" without any sense of outrage or hatred about it.Alright now for some gripes:Fury is just a carbon copy of Amren. What is the point of her whole character? Bryce could have been partying with June that night; Rhun could have put a gun to Hunts head and rode Bryce off on the wave runner; Rhun also could have been the one with a helicopter stashed off site. What did Fury actually do for the plot?Everyone is soooooooooooo super crazy off the charts perfectly hot, and also, everyone is insanely deadly. Now I get it, they are Vanir and Angels, but come on. Is there no such thing as an ugly werewolf or an unattractive mermaid? And everyone is a super honed amazing assassin. Fury, Bryce's adopted dad, Rhun and his friends, Hunt, every werewolf, etc. Everyone is stunningly hot and dangerous. To us, they might be, but if that was your entire world your entire life wouldnt it seem a little trite? If everyone is hot, does it mean anything anymore?Also like others have said, jesus with the overkill about Bryce being scorch-the-earth-hot. I get it if Conner & Hunt are super attracted to her, and if she gets hit on occasionally. But it is literally like every male she meets throughout the book can't bear to keep their hands off her. Every time she walks down the street every male is just falling all over themselves to look at her. It definitely feels slathered on a little thick.One of the biggest things that bugs me though is this: The last third of the book. Oh my god. Everything happening on screen, Micah going all Bond Villain and giving a long monologue explaining everything he did and why and just happened to be on camera for everyone important to see. Eye roll. We weren't even with Bryce during most of the action but rather watching it alongside the other secondary characters. The whole scene with the Nok was absolutely unnecessary and just felt like it was dragging out the ending of the book. Micah could have slammed Bryce into the tank, resulting in it cracking and her being severely injured, and Lele still could have broken the glass without the whole Syrinx-Rescue/Nok-Fight even needing to happen. In fact, it would have felt more believable that the Nok fought Micah and occupied him long enough for Bryce to escape than for Micah, the Archangel, the immensely powerful Governor, to have been....conveniently locked in a magically warded bathroom while a whole other scene got played out. It just felt totally unnecessary.Okay- now- last major gripe:THE LAST 50 PAGES OF THE BOOK. What the hell? Did we suddenly get transported into A Court of Thorn and Roses? Portals to Hel opening up all over the city, the lead character running around fighting in hand-to hand combat to protect helpless citizens, the magical companions fighting demons with her.......it felt like I was suddenly watching Feyre, not Bryce. On top of that, while I appreciate the symbolism of Bryce using Danika's sword, it felt totally unrealistic to see a woman who spent the last five years of her life first partying and being a college student then an antiquities desk clerk suddenly is an amazing sword wielding killer. The gun thing is believable due to her Stepfather and the scene at the gun range. But we never once see Bryce mention ever knowing how to use a sword or pick one up, but suddenly she's single handedly taking on an army of demons with flawless sword fighting? I really enjoyed the ending bit with her making the Drop and Danika being there (so touching) but other than that the very last part of the book suddenly felt like it was just a rehashing of the battle scene from A Court of Mist & Fury.The ending of the book wrapped everything up pretty well, but it also leaves a lot unanswered. Bryce admits that the entire city saw her use her Starborn powers and that she is now more powerful than any other mixed-species has ever been before. She even says the Fae & Angels can't let it stand that she showed their caste system was invalid. And yet, the highest Angels told her just to lay low and they would leave them alone. Obviously, we know that they probably don't, but I feel like a cliffhanger as to what would happen now in the fate of humans Vs Vanir/Angels and what that revelation was going to mean for Bryce would have worked better than just wrapping it up in a neat but not really logical bow.I still liked the books, I still like the characters and I am excited for the next one, but hopefully some of these issues will be corrected going forwards.Anyway that concludes my long as heck summary, thanks for reading!!!

A Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 5),32.4,4.8,"I absolutely LOVED this book from start to finish! I (like most people) disliked Nesta from the beginning, but this book is so beautifully written, it made me love Nesta with my whole heart despite her shortcomings. SJM makes this character so relatable while also making the whole story unpredictable and addicting! The extra spice (compared to the other books in the series) is an added, and very-welcomed, bonus! This was most definitely my favorite in the series- love her or hate her, Nesta makes one hell of a great story!!

The Creative Act: A Way of Being,32.4,4.7,"You know, those books that you read that you want to buy in bulk and gift to everyone you have ever met - and keep on hand for everyone you will ever meet?This is THAT book for me.I can’t even explain it’s magic or compare it to anything else I’ve ever read. It is by no means a religious book. I would not really classify it as self-help either. It stands alone - unless there is a genre for books that live, breathe, and have a soul. If you have ever wanted to read the Bible (or other holy text) but struggle with the language to get to the underlying message, this could be an alternate option. Thoughtfully and patiently crafted. Simple, sweet, impactful, magical, relatable…just so beautiful in every way.***update*** - after reading several of the less than 5-star reviews I decided to add this since it appears the expectation laid out in the Preface may have been missed by some who cannot seem to appreciate the refreshing simplicity and implied purpose of this text as communicated in the Preface - see photo for Preface screenshot.It FEELS as if this book was intentionally designed to reach as many human minds as possible. This human experience causes us to attach to multiple identities throughout this life - some more permanent than others. I have considered what it might have been like to have this book through every phase of my life so far. When I reflect on all the beliefs that have been rooted, recycled, or replaced, I think I would have cherished this book the most through every major period of growth. Now at age 50, I am regularly challenging my beliefs and biases and I turn to this book frequently for inspiration to that affect. To achieve a work that is easily digestible to every identify and phase of life…that in and of itself must be a daunting task to undertake these days so BRAVO!!!IF you are expecting a book chock full of the authors’ legendary work, this is not that book. Though some of the ideas reference the authors’ experiences with other well-knows, the examples selected are brief and (I feel) carefully curated to support ideas as an example to serve as further clarity and reach every level of comprehension.IF you are looking for a step by step guide on how to…whatever you are into, also NOT that book (see Preface)IF you are looking for a scientific, intellectual, complicated, book full of new ideas to debate with your bourgeoisie friends to see whose most woke (yes I said it)…look elsewhere.BUT…. If you are looking for what seems to be a plea from one human beings’ humble heart to the rest of humanity…THIS is THAT book!

A Court of Thorns and Roses eBook Bundle: A 5 Book Bundle,32.4,4.8,"So, product review first. Pretty dang good. I came across like 1 to 3 pages or something that were printed lighter than the other pages, but not all that noticeable. I tend to notice super duper tiny details and flaws. Another thing, on 1 page there was like something on the page that I couldn't get off. I dunno what it was, and it wasn't that big, but it did kinda bug me because I wanted these books to be PERFECT. BUT the products good, shipping was pretty okay, like 4 or some days to get here, felt super long because I ordered them with a feeling that I like needed to reread them or I was going to die sort of thing. But yeah. Just buy em. I kinda am regretting not getting hardcovers, but like, I'm cheap and I barely got myself to pay for the paperbacks.STORY REVIEW! Read them. They aren't super spicy, to me at least. A court of silver flames is definitely one of the spicier ones. The spice doesn't take you away from the story or distracts you. Acotar may be a bit slow at first, but stick with it. Please, you'll thank me later. It's just, it's indescribable. It's a good story, I love it, and I recommend it. Just read them. Also, the bat boys, OH MAH GAWD. I love them all. I couldn't decided which one I love more, they are all so fricken cute and hot and amazing in their own ways. But yeah, I recommend!!!!!

The materials are decent (except the wheels) and should hold up for a while. The wheels are super cheap and I'm going to need to replace those to keep marks off my laminate floors.

I do wish it had a lever tilt adjustment for the back, you cant lean back in it at all. I think the knob on the bottom will adjust the tilt somewhat, not really sure, the only directions that came in the box were pictures of the assembly, fortunately the assembly was really simple.

All Good People Here: A Novel,32.4,4.4,"All Good People Here by Ashley Flowers is the perfect small-town mystery. I was insanely invested in this story and wanted so bad for there to be some kind of big revelation so when I got to the end, I was a little let down. Too much is left open for speculation. HOWEVER, I sat on my thoughts for a few hours before writing up my review and I have to say I LOVE how this book ended. All the buildup from the story still weighs heavily on me but when I put it in perspective, it comes off as REAL. Not every case will be wrapped up in a pretty bow with answers to all the questions we have. Perhaps more things will come to light later down the road (and maybe even another book?) and perhaps not. But that is REAL crime so this book, while frustrating in that aspect, really made it stand out to me over other mysteries I’ve read.All in all, I loved this one! I can see why it’s been so popular among thriller fans, and I can also see why people may not have loved it. The book is extremely detail oriented, suspenseful, and intriguing for those who enjoy a book that deals with true crime cases. However, it doesn’t have a perfect ending which will leave some readers feeling annoyed. Either way, I do recommend and am crossing my fingers that the author continues to write because I’m a fan!𝗣𝗘𝗥𝗙𝗘𝗖𝗧 𝗙𝗢𝗥 𝗙𝗔𝗡𝗦 𝗢𝗙❥ Small Town Mysteries❥ Murder Mysteries❥ Cold case type books with shocking twists and turns𝗠𝗬 𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗚: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The Teacher,32.4,4.3,"The story was just fine. I wouldn’t call it a psychological thriller for adults, and even I read a lot of young adult books and i thought m it was just fine. I didn’t think it was bad, didn’t think it was great. It had a good story and it kept me reading til the end, which Is good! The ending was awesome but (spoiler) kinda confusing with the shoe store (is it father son? Is Hudson supposed to be jay? How could he be if he goes to the school, the teacher would have know him??)My problem with this book is that is for the first 3/4 of the book I was waiting for the hammer to drop and there just wasn’t really enough to keep me going and then the last 1/4 of the book everything happens at once. I love a good point of view chapter reading so I think that kept me invested through to the end. Anyways, all in all, definitely wasn’t a bad read! Would recommend if you enjoy young adult novels, which. I do.

She truly is an amazing canatadora!

Excalibur,32.4,4.7,"I am reviewing the entire Warlords Chronicles because I believe they should stand together. After reading the first book, I couldn’t wait to read the second, and the same for the third. This wasn’t the Arthur I knew from childhood tales or “Camelot,” but even a more heroic figure. This was Arthur the warrior.Cornwell draws his characters so well, sets the scene well, makes you care for each character as if they were sitting across from you at a fire ring at a campsite. I cried when Arthur went down and was carried off to the ship for his final voyage. The battle scenes were so real you could almost smell the salt from the sea, feel the sand under your felt and see the blood spurting from bodies.I hate that there’s not another book in the chronicles. Now I have to leave the world of Dumnonia and delve into another world. Bravo, Bernard Cornwell!

Circe,32.4,4.6,"This story is both enchanting and horrifically fascinating, just as good Greek drama should be. Circe's story is beautifully written and gorgeously interpreted by Madeline Miller. I absolutely adored this story of a woman finding her identity and coming into her own power on her own terms.I was absolutely spellbound by Circe and her adventures. Her ever-changing role in her dysfunctional family of deities is an astounding transformation. She had me cheering and tearing up for her strength of character and her courage to take on life as it came at her.I have never been one to get pulled in by mythology, but Madeline Miller makes me want to go back and read some classic literature. Bravo for her fresh take on this age-old story.

The Four Winds: A Novel,32.4,4.6,"Incredible book, Kristin Hannah!So much bravery, sorrow, yet incredible moments of joy, especially in the ""little"" things we ""Americans"" take for granted now. And hope! We are lost when we lose hope.The entire story meant so much more to me than it would have pre-covid pandemic.  My great-grandmother lived through the Great Depression and would talk about the effects here in Northern Vermont. Her experience even shaped how my grandmother stored food, always ready for shortage and to some degree my mother.To live through the Dust Bowl or many of the horrible times when there was never enough of anything and basic human needs were ignored by those who had more than enough but chose to lie to themselves and cast those who by no fault of their own lost everything, as if they chose to live that way, disgusting.  I was so angry many times that I definitely identified with Loreda! But only bc I always had enough and an abundance of love!I was taught to always look out for those who had less than you did, eben if what you have isn't much, and I'm grateful for that legacy.

A Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses Book 5),32.4,4.8,"This book is one of my favorite books of all time.The journey Nesta takes in terms of mental health is similar to my own. Watching her find herself through movement, meditation, and trauma bonding with new friends feels like I am watching my own story back … but if I was Fae with super powers.Watching Nesta transform from reactive to being able to accept love again is beyond special and honestly important in our escapist books. SO many people hate Nesta and don't love this book but I think that is the point. Nesta is a great example of someone who experiences trauma and becomes very destructive through it. We need more characters like Nesta. If you are someone who hates her maybe get a little introspective and figure out WHY because honestly this book is a therapy session in itself.Cassian also has to be one of my favorite men who are written by a woman. He is kind and understanding. Cassian gives Nesta what she needs to find herself. He doesn't do it for her which is an element I love about this story. He is a strong support and the only person that holds her up when things are at their worst. I am lucky enough to have a couple of Cassian's in my life and his character makes me so emotional. I love him.Nesta finding her way alongside two other strong female characters is also a mood. She learns how to love her family again but then creates a family of her own and in turn they all heal each other. I just love the story of women uplifting other women to reach their best versions of themselves. Watching them train and become more confident is so much fun and had me in tears by the end.Honestly I have read this multiple times now and its exactly what kind of escapism I have needed to get through some difficult times. I cry every single time in that last couple hundred pages because I am so proud of these characters. I love them so much and its hard to fathom that they are just some in on paper. To me they are real.

The Creative Act: A Way of Being,32.4,4.7,"I will consistently be referencing this book throughout my creative process. What this book does is offers an alternative perspective on creativity, and gives page at the page of a great advice on how to come up with ideas, brainstorm, and execute creative projects.As a Christian, I found it interesting that he views creativity, as spiritual essentially, also find it interesting that he used a lot of Bible scriptures. A lot of his teachings appears to have stemmed from scripture, whether he will admit it or not. I’ve annotated mine to point out all of the scripture, because he would quote verse by verse, but not credit the BibleNonetheless, I refer to this book as the Bible for creatives. Not to get this any sort of divine context, but to me, it provides a lot of unknown information.If you are a believer, do Reed with discernment, as he mentions the so-called universe, being so perfectly created in genius and broadcasting ideas, he does not mention that this universe he speaks of is a spiritual realm that has both negative and positive ideas. Please test all ideas to see if they thrive from memorial perspectiveFor example, and rap music, we may see that music artist have great ideas, but a lot of times it had lead to evil. Though this idea may have a good beat, the root of it clearly shows where it came from

I highly recommend this series, the author is amazing at what she does. Romance, twists, that “aha” moments later in the books where everything comes together, the last 100 pages of each of these books were insane, breathtaking(literally), made me shed tears and all other feelings I could possibly feel.

It took me less than 30 minutes to put together, but I do construct furniture rather frequently so I'm not sure if that was fast or average. The directions were clear enough and the tools were included, which is always awesome. I'm not a small person and I feel comfortable sitting in this chair. It is sturdy and feels well made. It moves up and down easily. The arms move up and back out of the way which is nice to push it completely under my desk. Obviously I can't say if it's going to last a long time quite yet, but for now it looks really nice and is comfortable and affordable. I love it so far!

All Good People Here: A Novel,32.4,4.4,"I wanted to rate this higher. I was absolutely giving it four stars until the very last page. This book is very well written overall. It reads very quickly, clearly, and makes you want to keep going every time a chapter ends. There are lots of twists and most if not all of them make sense, some even made me want to start the book over so I could see how I missed some of the connections.The subject matter is dark. Very dark. This one is not for the faint of heart. There’s no real gore, but there’s violence involving children, especially near the very end, that won’t sit well with some people.Regardless of all of this, I was still enjoying it overall until it abruptly ended. The book answers most of the questions it asks but leaves such an important part of the plot unresolved that I can’t accept it as a reader. I hate open endings, personally. I’d rather not read a story at all if it doesn’t have a clear ending. Perhaps the author who typically works with true crime, was trying to take a page from reality where there aren’t necessarily happy endings, but this ending choice felt like a middle finger to the reader, and took away from what was overall a very solid novel.

The Women: A Novel,32.4,4.8,"""The women had a story to tell, even if the world wasn't quite yet ready to hear it, and their story began with three simple words. - We were there""Enlightening, informative and a fitting tribute to the female service women and medical staff who served in Vietnam, but whose voice was never heard because ‘no women were there’. Kristin Hannah is an author who always demonstrates the immense healing power through storytelling, where voices are no longer silent, and in this book ‘The Women’, she has written a fabulous heartbreaking story and an eye opening account of events in Vietnam that conquers without coercion and agitates without exaggerating.The Plot - Many know something of the war in Vietnam, yet many like me knew little of the number of the women in service and the female medical staff who suffered, endured, and lived through that conflict. Frankie brings to life the role and treatment of women, who until later years were barely acknowledged despite the crucial role many played in the war. While the men were branded heroes, the country was dishonourably quiet about the role that their women played. Women who witnessed many of the same horrors, lost their lives, and endured injuries like many men but to American citizens – they weren’t even there.This very human story of Frankie took us on a journey through this distressing period in history, and takes us through the decision to sign up, how her family relationships became strained with the decision, and then the impact on her because of her parent’s lack of support, particularly her fathers. Add to that the loss of the three men in Frankie's life, her brother and her two loves and her re-integration back into society and 'normal' life and we have one of the most memorable historical fiction books I have ever read.Review and Comments - 'The Women' is an exquisite novel that will leave imprints on your heart and in your mind a long time after reading, not just about the brutality of war and loss on both sides, but the treatment and deafening silence about the role the women played. The book has an abundance of great characters, particularly Frankie who was portrayed as a very human person. An incredible woman, strong, determined, and courageous with an enormous capacity for love and forgiveness, but who for years suffered from the effects of war and because she ‘was not there’ never received the care and support needed to prevent PTSD.The storyline is superb, and the writing style is stunning. Historical fiction at its best as Kristin Hannah manages to hold a mirror up to society displaying themes of corruption, dishonour, loss, tragedy, PTSD, family relationships, and isolation as women and society struggled to contend and confront the very harsh reality of the story of ‘The Women’ in Vietnam. An awakening for many, then and now. An authentic account of an unforgotten and untold story. Sometimes brutal, sometimes beautiful. They were there.

"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, 2)",32.4,4.8,"I recently embarked on a literary adventure like no other, and it left me utterly spellbound. Sarah J.

Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear,32.4,4.5,"Honestly, there's nothing revolutionary in this book as far as what Gilbert is saying. She hasn't found some magical new formula for unlocking your creativity. Instead, what she has done is create a dialog, as if you were sitting down to coffee with a friend and confessing that you really wanted to be creative but... Gilbert deals with the variety of things that could follow that ""but"", and she pulls apart each and every one.Will everyone appreciate this book? Probably not. Gilbert does slay some pretty sacred cows, including the notion of the ""tortured"" artist, but I think she makes a very compelling case for all the cows she slays. The bottom line of this book, really, is do you want to be a creative person because you want the sense of accomplishment and transcendence that creativity can inspire, or do you want to be a creative person because you're hoping to make millions and be lauded by the masses? If it's the second, Gilbert basically tells you that you need not apply, and I agree with her. Creativity may pay off monetarily or in the form of social approbation, or it may not, but if all you really want is to create, who cares? Gilbert holds up all the fears that commonly hold people back and says, ""So what?""While I'm not a religious person, I got where she was going by likening creativity to a sort of religious calling. As she says, she doesn't advocate for people moving out to a mountain and living a life of solitary devotion to creativity--unless that's your thing, in which case you should do it. Instead, she's advocating for creativity as a form of not just self-expression, but as a way for people to make something beautiful solely for the sake of making something beautiful. As she says, it's both essential and non-essential. At heart, I think that's what makes us human: that we create things that aren't necessary merely because we like the look of them, or the sound of them, or the taste of them, or the way they feel when we wear them. It's in the act of creating--even if our creation is bad or misunderstood or unloved--that we are able to get outside of our own heads for a bit. We can forget about our mundane worries and struggles and we can experience moments of pure joy.Not that she's saying that all this can come about without some fear and struggle and some sense of pain. What she advises is that we learn to live with these things without allowing them to control us. I know this seems simplistic, but she does such a great job of laying out how to avoid being controlled by your fears. What she's revealing here is that what holds most people back is themselves. What does it matter if people dismiss your creativity or think you're strange? The best kind of creativity, Gilbert says, is the kind that's done entirely because *you* want to do it, not because you're trying to appeal to the masses. The Big Magic, really, is experiencing the joys of creativity for yourself and not for some nebulous, unknown consumer market. If you're fortunate, the market may follow. If not, it won't. Either way, you'll have created something and will have the pride of knowing that it's yours. And when you're done, you'll let it loose, acknowledge that it may not be perfect, and go on to make something else. You can do all this with a sense of awe that you're doing something that fulfills a need deep within yourself. It won't feed you or clothe you or put a roof over your head (unless your creative outlet is something like farming or weaving or carpentry, in which case you may well fulfill some of these essential needs as well), but it will provide you with experiences that you can hoard like treasures, to be pulled out and admired and marveled at whenever you so desire.Reading this book was so good for me because it helped me to see how counterproductive some of the nagging voices in the back of my head are. It encouraged me to take creative leaps and to be philosophical when those leaps sometimes fail, as they inevitably will. Gilbert has helped me to see that, no matter what, I will always long for that creative outlet, so why bother denying it to myself? I can engage with it for the pure joy of engaging with it, and if anything else comes of it, great. If not, well, I'll have been living the life I want to live, and that really counts for more than anything else.

Her world-building is nothing short of awe-inspiring, with each court, be it Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, or the deadly Night Court, brought to life with meticulous detail and captivating lore.The characters in this book are nothing short of brilliant. Feyre, our fearless and resourceful protagonist, is a character you can't help but root for. She's a hunter, a survivor, and her transformation throughout the story is both empowering and heart-wrenching. And then there's the enigmatic High Lord of the Night Court, Rhysand, whose charisma and complexity make him one of the most intriguing male leads I've ever encountered in fantasy literature. The relationships, the alliances, and the betrayals that unfold are as compelling as they are unpredictable.The plot itself is a rollercoaster of emotions and surprises. It seamlessly weaves together elements of romance, action, and mystery, keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The twists and turns will leave you breathless, and the romance that blooms amid the chaos is nothing short of epic.What truly sets ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" apart is its exploration of themes such as love, sacrifice, and the blurry line between good and evil. Maas delves deep into the hearts of her characters, making you feel every joy and sorrow right along with them. It's a tale that lingers in your mind long after you've turned the final page.

Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,32.4,4.8,"Having read Coates’s “We Were Eight Years in Power” and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o’s “Globalectics” (see my reviews), I wanted to get a woman’s perspective on similar issues. When looking through recent titles along these lines, I came upon, sampled, and bought Wilkerson’s book. The initial narrative as well as her preliminary remarks comparing conditions in the US with those in India and WW II Germany provoked my curiosity as well as questions regarding inferences and conclusions she would draw. As with the previous books, I was again devastated by the compelling argument relating our American racial/class hierarchy and its explanatory power regarding recent events.Within the book, the author proceeds to make her case through an Introduction (‘A Man in the Crowd’), some 31 chapters broken into seven parts and an Epilogue (‘A World Without Caste’). The parts are as follows: (1) Toxins in the Permafrost and Heat Rising all Around; (2) The Arbitrary Construction of Human Divisions; (3) The Eight Pillars of Caste; (4) The Tentacles of Caste; (5) The Consequences of Caste; (6) Backlash; and (7) Awakening. There are also Dedication and Acknowledgement along with extensive Notes and Bibliography sections.Some of the parts that stood out for me began with the author’s framing of her study of caste. For instance, Wilkerson observes (at Location 233 in the Kindle version) that “The election [in 2016] would set the United States on a course toward isolationism, tribalism, the walling in and protecting of one’s own, the worship of wealth and acquisition at the expense of others, even of the planet itself . . .” A little later (Location 276), she adds “Then the worst pandemic in more than a century brought humanity to a standstill.” Her attention turns to questions (Location 280-86) “What had happened to America? What could account for tens of millions . . . [to] ‘vote against their own interests’. . .”  After indicating (Location 357) that “Like old houses, America has an unseen skeleton, a caste system that is as central to its operation . . .” along with its imposed racial and power dimensions, the author clarifies her quest across oceans for understanding and explanation (bringing to mind Weiner’s “Socrates Express” and Zakaria’s “Ten Lessons for a Post Pandemic World”---see my reviews).Wilkerson goes back and forth in place and time between the US, India and Nazi Germany to explore the origins, character and insidious effects of such caste systems. For instance, she relates (Location 1158-59) that “Both countries enacted a fretwork of laws to chain the lowliest group—Dalits in India and African-Americans in the United States—to the bottom, using terror and force to keep them there . . . ‘Perhaps only the Jews have as long a history of suffering from discrimination as the Dalits’. . .” In one of many examples later (Location 1213-14), the author describes that “In the early stages of the Third Reich . . . Nazi bureaucrats met to weigh the options for imposing a rigid new hierarchy, one that would isolate Jewish people from Aryans now that the Nazis had taken control. . . [They studied] how the United States had managed to turn its racial hierarchy into rigid law yet retain such a sterling reputation on the world stage.”While the book begins and finishes strong, there is much substantiating material in-between to go through to get to the many gems hidden within the text. For instance, Wilkerson indicates (in Location 4754-59) that “The 2016 election became a remarkable blueprint of caste hierarchy in America, from highest to lowest status in a given group’s support of the Republican: White men voted for Trump at 62 percent. White women at 53 percent. Latino men at 32 percent. Latina women at 25 percent. African-American men at 13 percent, and black women at 4 percent . . . The Democratic vote went as follows: White men, 31 percent. White women, 43 percent. Latino men, 63 percent. Latina women, 69 percent. African-American men, 82 percent. [and] African-American women, supported the white female Democrat by 94 percent.” Even while such references and the author’s anecdotes are helpful, I find myself seeking other sources to help spell out minority women’s situation and perspective further for someone like me (e.g., see Angela Davis’s “Women, Race, and Class” and other such works).As the author expresses the tremendous personal/societal cost and detrimental human impact of our caste system, she admits the limitations of a book such as hers and the challenges in resolving matters. However, her text is well worth reading and offers the possibility of awakening regarding these issues and pursing a vision for a better world. As she states in her conclusion (Location 5553-55), “In a world without caste, being male or female, light or dark, immigrant or native-born, would have no bearing on what anyone was perceived as being capable of. . . we would all be invested in the well-being of others in our species if only for our own survival, and recognize that we are in need of one another more than we have been led to believe.”

The Four Winds: A Novel,32.4,4.6,"When Elsa, who believes herself to be unattractive and useless in a family that treats her ""less than others"" finally gathers enough courage to sneak out of the house and see what it's like to go someplace other than church she meets a young man and gets pregnant. Her family forces her to marry the boy she doesn't really know.In time the successful wheat farming Martinelli family learns to love her and her children with acceptance and more love she has ever experienced.The Dust Bowl days and years begin near Dalhart, Texas causing hardship that worsens year after year. Elsa finally decides to go to California to start anew with her children after her son develops a lung condition.California is filling up with emigrants day by day. Work is almost nonexistent. Families live in squalor and disease. They are taken advantage of by the wealthy farmers.Eventually, Elsa and her children join others to protest the conditions. Many injuries and deaths occur from violence while continued illnesses, deprivation, and giving up take many lives.Having known families who experienced the dust bowl this book broke my heart and stole it at the same time. Kristin Hannah does her research and it always shows. I gave this book five stars because it is brutally honest with strong characters who think they're weak and poignant attention to emotional detail.

Fourth Wing (The Empyrean Book 1),32.4,4.8,"Esse livro foi recomendação, e eu amei cada minuto que passei lendo. Ele mistura vários temas de outros livros que já conhecemos, mas a história é muito viciante. Eu fiquei super ansiosa lendo, me peguei brigando com os personagens. A escrita é meio adolescente e me incomoda um pouco a autora usar algumas palavras modernas, pois me tira da ambientação. É uma leitura fácil e leve, li em dois dias, pois estava gripada e não tinha o que fazer. Tirando alguns furos no enredo, eu fiquei meio brava que a protagonista é tida como brilhante e a mais inteligente de todos, mas ela deixa passar umas coisas tão básicas que não faz sentido algum. Por exemplo, logo no início do livro quando eles se conhecem Xaden já dá a entender umas coisas que ela só tem uma epifania laaaaaaa na frente. É frustrante!Enfim, terminei o segundo livro e agora tô deprimida. Kkkk Fiquei uma hora no Reddit lendo teorias.

"Executive Office Chair Mid Back Swivel Computer Task, Ergonomic Leather-Padded Desk Seats with Lumbar Support,Armrests, Black",32.4,4.3,"Very nice chair. Just got it and put it together. Was quite easy until I got to the part to attach the back to the arms. That was a real battle. Finally, I loosened the arm screws quite a bit then was able to wrestle the back in place. I suggest leaving those arm screws and the back attachment ones loose, then make sure everything's settled in place. Tighten them up, each a little at a time until all are tight. There is nothing written, just pictures which are clear enough but I think there should be at least my suggestion about attaching the back.The chair looks really nice and it's comfortable. I don't use an office chair often, maybe an hour a day. As long as the height mechanism doesn't fail I'm fine with it. That's why I replaced an older one.I bought a light brown but it is a bit darker than I would like, but nbd.Also, on the pamphlet it says 110 kg which is about 240lbs.I will add I'm a 75 yo female who is pretty good at assembling things. The only issue was the struggle to place the back. Took a break and went back and did it.Update:. I wrote to the customer service address about how I couldn't move that knob in either direction and that the lever to raise and lower the seat is also supposed to move sideways to recline the back. The high school line drawings in their instruction pamphlet show what I was supposed to do. They wrote back to do exactly what I told them I couldn't do. There's a slot for the lever to move in, it is vertical. How it's supposed to go back and forth in that metal slot, I don't know. And I can't move that knob right or left or out to adjust.As it stands right now. I can't recline that back even one inch.So, I've changed my rating to 3 stars based on the problem and on their useless response.

NEO CHAIR Ergonomic Office Chair PU Leather Executive Chair Padded Flip Up Armrest Computer Chair Adjustable Height High Back Lumbar Support Wheels Swivel for Gaming Desk Chair (White),32.4,4.3,"This is one of the best purchases I lumbar support. My physical therapist advised I needed a chair with a high back and adequate cushion to remind me to sit strait with my shoulder blades touching the surface to prevent slouching as well as good cushion on my tush to preve presher ob the upper spine. This chair hits all points.This chair hits all points my PT specialist  asked for.  This is an increadible chair for the money. Since America manufacturers very little, I am quite sure unless they are made of real leather, those 200.00-300.00 chairs that looks just like this one are probably the same chair.The chair comes with instructions,  that are easy to read, just don't  jump ahead and put the cylinder that connects the chair to the wheeled feet on the chair first, it will make attaching and alignment if other parts cumbersome. Front, back, arms is the top order, then put extension legs together, wheels and cylinder on the wheeled legs. Attach top to bottom and your ready to roll...no pun on.words 😊. What truly makes the assembly easy is the screws are marked alphabetically  on the package and on the directions so you know exactly where they go.Its a good fit for medium to tall heights as well as medium to heavy builds I weight  208 and it is  a comfy fit. I can't  remember if the weight limit was on this item,  but most limits are around 245 lbs on this style of chair. If you are in doubt contact the seller.  If they don't  answer, don't  buy. Plenty more of these of equal quality anf similar  price with a available stats.The fabric does not have to be handled delicatley, but at same time you get what you paid for. This is not real leather so clean with a damp cloth only. No detergent of any sorts it will react and slowly (or quickly) degrade the synthetic  (plastic or pleather if it makes you feel better). Dawn dish washing  liquid my seem gentle if it gets dirty in the arm/head area. Dawn is designed to break down oil. Pleather is oil based. Over time it would  soften your fabric leaving it open to tears. This chair is very sturdy, but remember this is not a 2000.00 Knoll. This chair is not designed for frequent weeeee spins by your children and definitely not the adult. The same for the constant manipulation of the arms.
